Thus, recovery arms or studies are not always critical to conclude whether an adverse effect is reversible. The demonstration of full reversibility is not considered essential. A trend towards reversibility (decrease in incidence or severity), and scientific assessment that this trend would eventually progress to full reversibility, are generally sufficient. If full reversibility is not anticipated, this should be considered in the clinical risk assessment. A toxicity study that includes a terminal non-dosing period is generally warranted if a scientific assessment cannot predict whether the toxicity will be reversible and if:
* there is severe toxicity at clinically relevant exposures (e.g., \(\leq 10\)-fold the clinical exposure); or
* the toxicity is only detectable at an advanced stage of the pathophysiology in humans and where significant reduction in organ function is expected. (The assessment of reversibility in this case should be considered even at \(>10\)-fold exposure multiples.) A toxicity study that includes a terminal non-dosing period is generally not warranted when the toxicity:
* can be readily monitored in humans at an early stage before the toxicity becomes severe; or
* is known to be irrelevant to humans (e.g., rodent Harderian gland toxicity); or
* is only observed at high exposures not considered clinically relevant (see 2 above for exception); or
* is similar to that induced by related agents, and the toxicity based on prior clinical experience with these related agents is considered a manageable risk.
If a study of reversibility is called for, it should be available to support clinical studies of a duration similar to those at which the adverse effects were seen nonclinically. However, a reversibility study is generally not warranted to support clinical trials of a duration equivalent to that at which the adverse effect was not observed nonclinically. If a particular lesion is demonstrated to be reversible in a short duration (e.g., 2-week or 1-month) study, and does not progress in severity in longer term studies, repeating the reversibility assessment in longer term toxicity studies is generally not warranted. If a reversibility study is warranted, it is efficient to conduct it as part of a chronic study so that all toxicities of concern can be assessed in a single study, provided that it is not critical to conduct it earlier to support a specific clinical trial.",M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals ,"Question: When is assessment of reversibility considered to be appropriate and is it important to demonstrate full reversibility or is it sufficient to demonstrate the potential for full reversibility?
  Answer: ICH M3(R2) states the following in section I.D General Principles (1.4): ""The goals of the nonclinical safety evaluation generally include a characterization of toxic effects with respect to target organs, dose dependence, relationship to exposure, and, when appropriate, potential reversibility."" Evaluation of the potential for reversibility of toxicity (i.e., return to the original or normal condition) should be provided when there is severe toxicity in a nonclinical study with potential adverse clinical impact. The evaluation can be based on a study of reversibility or on a scientific assessment. The scientific assessment of reversibility can include the extent and severity of the pathologic lesion, the regenerative capacity of the organ system showing the effect and knowledge of other drugs causing the effect. Thus, recovery arms or studies are not always critical to conclude whether an adverse effect is reversible. The demonstration of full reversibility is not considered essential.

  Answer: Exploratory clinical studies do not represent a commitment to full development. Therefore, when intent is to conduct the exploratory clinical study in one sex only, the single-dose toxicity studies can be restricted to that sex. However, in such cases, animal group sizes for the Day 2 termination should be increased, as it is normal to combine effects from both sexes with respect to identifying and characterizing toxicities that are not sex-specific.

In Approach 4, the high dose in both the rodent and nonrodent studies is based on multiples of the proposed human exposure, and thus the high-dose selection recommendations described in section I.E (1.5) are not applied to either species.

Because Approach 4 uses exposure multiples for the high-dose selection in both species, it is possible that potential toxicity might not be identified in either species.

A minimum treatment period for a single nonclinical juvenile animal study is three months. The appropriateness of the duration should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. In some cases, a shorter duration may be justified.

E3_Structure_and_Content_of_Clinical_Study_Reports_-_Questions_and_Answers_(R1)_JANUARY_2013.mmd,"Guideline title: E3 Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports Some in the pharmaceutical industry have expressed concern that the ICH E3 guidance, Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports (ICH E3), is intended as a requirement (i.e., a template that must be followed). The fact that the ICH M4 guidance for the Common Technical Document (CTD) refers to specific structural elements described in ICH E3 (e.g., Clinical Study Report (CSR) section headings) may have contributed to this interpretation. Interpretation of ICH E3 as a rigid templatecan result in presentation of redundant and suboptimal information in CSRs. This is a particular problem when ICH E3 is used for studies for which it was not designed (e.g., pharmacokinetic studies or studies with health economic or quality of life outcomes). Can ICH reaffirm that ICH E3 is a guidance and not a required template and that ICH E3 can be adapted to report studies that fall outside the original scope of ICH E3?","Yes. ICH E3 is a guidance, not a set of rigid requirements or a template, and flexibility is inherent in its use. ""The [guidance] is intended to assist sponsors in the development of a report that is complete, free from ambiguity, well organized, and easy to review."" Modifications and adaptations to the structure presented in the guidance that lead to better display and communication of information are encouraged.

The introduction to ICH E3 (page 3) clearly indicates that ICH E3 is to be interpreted as a guidance, not a set of requirements: ""Each report should consider all of the topics described (unless clearly not relevant) although the specific sequence and grouping of topics may be changed if alternatives are more logical for a particular study. Some data in the appendices are specific requirements of individual regulatory authorities and should be submitted as appropriate. The numbering should then be adapted accordingly.""

To illustrate this flexibility, consider demographic baseline information. ICH E3 suggests presentation of this information in the efficacy evaluation, but many variations of this presentation are possible. For example, if the efficacy and safety populations differ substantially, it would be appropriate to present demographic and baseline characteristics for the safety and efficacy populations in the safety and efficacy sections or in a new section preceding the efficacy and safety results sections.

If particular types of information or topics are not addressed in ICH E3 or if their location is not specified, this information or topic should be placed in the section that is most relevant. For example, pharmacokinetic or quality of life results could be placed in appropriately identified subsections of the efficacy and safety results sections, or they could be placed in new, appropriately identified results sections.

If a report does not address all the aspects of ICH E3 that are relevant for a given study, this should be clearly indicated and the rationale for doing so should be provided -- for example, if there is no presentation of efficacy for an efficacy study. A rationale is not necessary if sections presented in ICH E3 are reordered, renamed, or deleted (if warranted by the study design) or if new sections are added.

It should be noted that ICH E3 was developed for submission of adequate and well-controlled clinical effectiveness studies. Nevertheless, the basic principles described can be applied to other kinds of trials, such as clinical pharmacology studies and open-label safety studies, recognizing that not all sections or data presentations may be appropriate or important for these other types of trials.

Alternatively, the sponsor can conduct a multinational study with one protocol for sites under the IND (U.S. sites and some foreign sites) and a different protocol(s) for foreign sites not under the IND.  If the intent is to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites, the protocols would ordinarily be very similar or identical.  The U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND must follow the protocol that was submitted to the IND.  For foreign sites that are not included under the IND, the protocol(s) does not need to be submitted to the IND.  In general, if the sponsor intends to submit the data in an application for marketing approval, we recommend that the sponsor identify the foreign sites that will not be conducted under the IND and discuss plans to pool the data from U.S. and foreign sites with the appropriate FDA review division.

Note, however, that 21 CFR 312.32(b) requires sponsors to promptly review information about the safety of the investigational drug obtained or otherwise received by the sponsor from any source, foreign or domestic.  Under 21 CFR 312.32(c), sponsors must also notify FDA and all participating investigators in an IND safety report of any adverse experience associated with the use of the drug that is both serious and unexpected.  This means that FDA and all participating investigators under the IND would be informed of such an adverse experience, even if it occurred in a foreign study not conducted under the IND.",Sponsor - Investigator - IRB Interrelationship Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators,"Question: Must foreign clinical study sites in a multinational study that includes domestic sites be conducted under an IND?
  Answer: No. A multinational study may include domestic sites under the IND and foreign sites not under the IND.  Investigation drug and biologics studies conducted in the U.S. must be conducted in compliance with the IND requirements contained in 21 CFR 312, which includes the requirement that investigators sign the 1572.  If a study also involves foreign clinical sites, the sponsor may choose, but is not required, to include the foreign clinical sites under the IND.  The investigators from the U.S. sites and any foreign sites included under the IND would be required to sign the 1572.

Because an HDE provides for marketing approval, use of the HUD does not constitute research or an investigation which would normally require consent from the study subjects. However, there is nothing in the law or regulations that prohibits a state or institution from requiring prospective informed consent, when feasible. In fact, most HDE holders have developed patient labeling that incorporates information that may be used to assist a patient in making an informed decision about the use of the device. For example, the patient labeling may contain a discussion of the potential risks and benefits of the HUD, as well as any procedures associated with the use of the device. The HUD labeling also states that the device is a humanitarian use device for which effectiveness for the labeled indication has not been demonstrated. See 21 CFR 814.104(b)(4)(ii).

Unless it is an emergency, before an HUD is used off-label, the agency recommends that the HDE holder obtain FDA approval of the use following the compassionate use policy for unapproved devices. (See Chapter III Expanded Access to Unapproved Devices of the ""IDE Policies and Procedures Guidance.""2) If FDA approves the compassionate use request, the physician should ensure that the patient protection measures are addressed before the device is used and should devise an appropriate schedule for monitoring the patient.

Section 561 of the Act, however, recognizes that there may be circumstances under which a health care provider may wish to use an unapproved device to save the life of a patient or to prevent irreversible morbidity when there exists no other alternative therapy. For investigational devices under an IDE, the IDE regulation permits deviations from the investigational plan without prior approval when necessary to protect the life or physical well-being of a subject in an emergency. (See 21 CFR 812.35(a)). A physician may treat a patient with an unapproved medical device in an emergency situation if he/she concludes that:

* The patient has a life-threatening condition that needs immediate treatment;7 Footnote 7: FDA considers _ife-threatening condition to include serious diseases or conditions such as sight-threatening and limb-threatening conditions as well as other situations involving risk of irreversible morbidity.
* No generally acceptable alternative treatment for the condition exists; and
* Because of the immediate need to use the device, there is no time to use existing procedures to get FDA approval for the use.

FDA expects the physician to make the determination that the patient's circumstances meet the above criteria, to assess the potential for benefit from the use of the unapproved device, and to have substantial reason to believe that benefits will exist. In the event that a device is used in circumstances meeting the criteria listed above, the physician should follow as many of the patient protection procedures listed below as possible:

* Informed consent from the patient or a legal representative;
* Clearance from the institution as specified by their policies;_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_

* Concurrence of the IRB chairperson;
* An assessment from a physician who is not participating in the study; and
* Authorization from the IDE sponsor, if an IDE exists for the device.

While prior approval for shipment or emergency use of the investigational device is not required, the use must be reported to FDA by the IDE sponsor within 5 working days from the time the sponsor learns of the use. 21 CFR 812.35(a)(2) and 812.150(a)(4). The report should contain a summary of the conditions constituting the emergency, patient outcome information, and the patient protection measures that were followed.

Unlike emergency use of an unapproved device discussed above, prior FDA approval is needed before compassionate use occurs. Section 561(b) of the act and 21 CFR 812.35. In order to obtain agency approval, the sponsor should submit an IDE supplement requesting approval for a protocol deviation under section 812.35(a) in order to treat the patient. The IDE supplement should include:

* A description of the patient's condition and the circumstances necessitating treatment;
* A discussion of why alternatives therapies are unsatisfactory and why the probable risk of using the investigational device is no greater than the probable risk from the disease or condition;
* An identification of any deviations in the approved clinical protocol that may be needed in order to treat the patient; and

The patient identified in the supplement should not be treated with the device until FDA approves its use under the proposed circumstances. In reviewing this type of request, FDA will consider the above information as well as whether the preliminary evidence of safety and effectiveness justifies such use and whether such use would interfere with the conduct of a clinical trial to support marketing approval.

If the request is approved, the attending physician should devise an appropriate schedule for monitoring the patient, taking into consideration the investigational nature of the device and the specific needs of the patient. The patient should be monitored to detect any possible problems arising from the use of the device.

For example, ""...as seen in the population PK study 101 (5.3.3.5)"" helps the reader to find the referenced study report under the Population PK Study Reports section. The text ""...no safety problems were noted in the uncontrolled pneumonia study 101A (5.3.5.2)"" helps the reader find the referenced study report under the section Study Reports of Uncontrolled Clinical Studies for the Pneumonia indication.

Therefore, sponsors should document their risk assessment, including methodologies used for the risk assessment, conclusions from the risk assessment, and how the assessment was used to make decisions on the management of the risks identified.

"Drug_and_Device_Manufacturer_Communications_With_Payors,_Formulary_Committees,_and_Similar_Entities__Questions_and_Answers_Guidance_for_Industry_and_Review_Staff_JUNE_2018.mmd","After reviewing Medical Device Reporting for Manufacturers Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What additional considerations apply to communications to payors about unapproved products and about unapproved uses of approved/cleared/licensed products?","Firms' communications regarding unapproved products and unapproved uses of approved/cleared/licensed medical products raise a number of potentially competing public health interests. FDA's approach to implementation of its authorities in this area seeks to balance these interests to best advance the public health overall.

Some firm communications regarding unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved/cleared/licensed medical products may potentially undermine substantial government interests related to health and safety. These interests include motivating the development of robust scientific data on safety and efficacy; maintaining the premarket review process for safety and efficacy of each intended use in order to prevent harm, to protect against fraud, misrepresentation, and bias, and to develop appropriate instructions for use for medical products; protecting the integrity and reliability of promotional information regarding medical product uses; and preventing the diversion of health care resources toward ineffective treatments.

FDA recognizes that there can be, in certain instances, tension between the public health interests directly advanced by the premarket review requirements and other important interests. For example, as discussed in section II of this guidance, FDA recognizes that payors, in some situations, need to plan for and make coverage and reimbursement decisions for medical products and uses far in advance of the effective date of such decisions. As a result, FDA recognizes the value of payors receiving unbiased, factual, accurate, and non-misleading information of the type described in Q.C.1/A.C.1 about unapproved products and unapproved uses of approved/cleared/licensed medical products in order to inform their decision-making.

FDA believes that the categories of information described in Q.C.1/A.C.1 are, on the one hand, broad enough to encompass the information that payors may need to make informed coverage and reimbursement decisions and, on the other hand, limited enough to maintain appropriate incentives for firms to conduct robust studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of unapproved products and unapproved uses of approved/cleared/licensed medical products. In addition, if firms follow the recommendations in Q.C.1/A.C.1 and provide unbiased, factual, accurate, and non-misleading information, FDA believes that the risk that payors will be misled is relatively low. Payors are a sophisticated audience with established procedures to carefully consider the full range of relevant evidence about new uses of medical products. Payors possess financial resources and motivation to closely scrutinize information from firms. In making decisions on a population basis, payors can draw on a range of expertise in multiple disciplines that allows them to critically evaluate information presented to them by firms, including an evaluation of the limitations and reliability of that information.

Thus, FDA believes the recommendations provided in this section of the guidance appropriately balance the competing interests described above for firms' communications with payor audiences about unapproved products and unapproved uses of approved/cleared/licensed products. Firms' communications to other audiences about unapproved products or unapproved uses of approved/cleared/licensed products could raise additional or different considerations and are beyond the scope of this guidance.59

Footnote 59: The Agency has issued other guidance documents that could apply to firms communications to other audiences. For example, FDA has issued a draft guidance for industry describing its thinking on how firms can respond to unsolicited requests for unapproved use information related to their FDA-approved prescription drugs and FDA-approved or cleared medical devices. See FDA_ draft guidance for industry _Responding to Unsolicited Requests for Off-Label Information About Prescription Drugs and Medical Devices_. In addition, FDA has provided separate guidances describing recommended practices for the dissemination by firms of scientific and medical publications discussing unapproved uses of approved drugs or approved or cleared medical devices.

Footnote 17: Note that certain proposed safety-related changes to the FDA-required labeling of medical products can be submitted to the Agency in changes being effected (CBE) supplements and firms may distribute the medical product with such labeling changes upon receipt by the Agency of the supplement for the change. See, for example, 21 CFR 314.70(c)(6), 601.12(f)(2), 514.8(c)(3), & 814.39(d). Firm communications that reflect changes to the labeling described in a pending CBE supplement (and that are otherwise consistent with the framework described in this guidance) would be considered consistent with the FDA-required labeling.

When reviewing a medical product's marketing application, FDA weighs the benefits and risks of a medical product for the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the product's labeling and determines whether the benefits of using the product under those conditions of use outweigh the potential or probable risks of the product. Under certain circumstances, FDA may also consider additional risks and potential harms in determining whether a product meets the relevant standard for marketing. For example, FDA may assess the risks of abuse or misuse of certain products, the potential for harm to the health of humans from certain animal drug uses, or the potential for harm to health from secondary exposure to certain medical products. If using a product in accordance with the representations/suggestions in a product communication increases the potential for harm to health relative to the information reflected in the FDArequired labeling, this indicates that the communication is not consistent with the FDA-required labeling. For example, if the representations or suggestions about use of the product would reasonably be expected to introduce new risks that are not included in the FDA-required labeling or to materially increase the rate of occurrence or severity of existing risks18 included in the FDA-required labeling, the communication would not be consistent with the FDA-required labeling.

Footnote 18: This factor is not intended to restrict firms from communicating about increased risks, such as risks observed with use of their products in clinical practice. For example, as described in the preceding footnote, firms communications can reflect changes to the labeling described in a pending CBE supplement, including supplements that add or strengthen contraindication, warning, precaution, or adverse reaction information in the FDA-required labeling, and such communications would be considered consistent with the FDA-required labeling. It is also not intended to restrict communications that describe minor differences in the rate of occurrence of common, non- serious adverse reactions (e.g., if a firm_ communication describes the rate of occurrence of headache observed in clinical practice, and this rate is slightly higher than the rate of occurrence of headache reflected in the FDA-required labeling from the clinical trials experience, this communication would not be considered to fail this factor). However, if a firm_ communication suggests use of its product in a way that would reasonably be expected to result in a clinically significant increase in the rate of occurrence or severity of an adverse event compared to what is described in the FDA-required labeling or in a way that would reasonably be expected to introduce a new risk that is not described in the FDA-required labeling, that would indicate the product communication is not consistent with the FDA-required labeling.",Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff,"Question: What is Factor 2 and how does it determine whether the product communication increases the potential for harm to health?

As a general matter, factor 1 primarily addresses situations where the information about the conditions of use described in the FDA-required labeling and in a firm's communication conflict with one another. However, while the FDA-required labeling provides essential information about the approved conditions of use, it is not intended to exhaustively address every possible scenario a firm could suggest in its communications - either to rule out or to endorse each possible scenario - and certain scenarios could negatively affect the safe and effective use of the product. As a result, simply analyzing whether there is a conflict between the information in the communication and the FDA-required labeling is not always sufficient to determine whether a communication is consistent with the FDA-required labeling. If a firm's communication suggests use of its product in a way that does not conflict with the FDA-required labeling but which nevertheless increases the potential for harm to health relative to the information reflected in the FDA-required labeling, the communication would not be consistent with the FDA-required labeling (factor 2). Similarly, if a firm's communication suggests use of a product in a way that does not conflict with the information in the FDA-required labeling but the FDA-required labeling would not provide adequate information to enable the product to be safely or effectively used under the conditions represented in the communication, the communication would not be consistent with the FDA-required labeling (factor 3).",Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff,"Question: How do Factors 1, 2, and 3 overlap in determining whether a product communication is consistent with the FDA-required labeling?

Medical_Product_Communications_That_Are_Consistent_With_the_FDA-Required_Labeling__Questions_and_Answers_Guidance_for_Industry_JUNE_2018.mmd,This question is about Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff What evidentiary support should a firm have for its CFL promotional communications?,"Under the FD&C Act and FDA's implementing regulations, labeling for drugs and devices and advertising for prescription drugs and restricted devices must be truthful and non-misleading, which includes revealing facts that are material about the product being promoted, including information about the risks of the product.20 When these communications lack appropriate evidentiary support, they are likely to be false or misleading and can cause patient harm. To be truthful and non-misleading, representations or suggestions made by firms about their products need to be grounded in fact and science and presented with appropriate context. Any data, studies, or analyses relied on should be scientifically appropriate and statistically sound to support the representations or suggestions made in a CFL promotional communication.

The safety and effectiveness of the drug or device under the conditions of use in the FDA-required labeling have already been established by appropriate evidence during the premarket review process (and/or through the device classification process). Therefore, FDA would not consider representations or suggestions in a CFL promotional communication to be false or misleading based only on the lack of evidence sufficient to satisfy the applicable approval/clearance standard. For example, evidence other than that which meets the new drug approval standard of ""substantial evidence"" of effectiveness could be used to support certain representations or suggestions about a prescription drug in a CFL promotional communication.21 Nevertheless, the communication could be false or misleading for other reasons. Accordingly, the representations or suggestions should be supported and presented as described in this guidance.

Footnote 21: In such circumstances, FDA does not intend to interpret its regulations, see, for example, 21 CFR 202.1(e)(6)(i), to the contrary.

The amount and type of evidence needed to support a particular CFL promotional communication depends in part on the topic addressed by the communication. For example, different evidence would be needed to support a long-term efficacy presentation than would be needed to support a presentation about a product's mechanism of action. The amount and type of evidence needed also depends on the particular representations or suggestions that are made about any given topic in the communication. We are aware that firms are interested in including information from a variety of types of studies and analyses in their product communications, including additional information from the studies that supported approval or clearance of their product and from postmarket studies and analyses of their product. As a general matter, FDA believes that a variety of types of studies and analyses can provide useful additional information about a medical product for its approved/cleared conditions of use. However, some of these studies or analyses do not, in and of themselves, allow for reliable conclusions to be drawn about the effects of the product. To be considered truthful and non-misleading, firms' product communications should not overstate the findings of or the conclusions that can be drawn from such studies or analyses, or fail to disclose their material limitations.

For example, certain analyses of pivotal trial data may provide information that elaborates on the data reflected in the product's FDA-required labeling and could add to understanding of a product (e.g., information from separate analyses of the individual components of a composite endpoint that was successfully used as the primary endpoint and that are derived from appropriate statistical tests22 and pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan). However, if the pivotal trial was, for example, not adequately powered to determine treatment effect on the individual components of the composite endpoint and/or type 1 error (false positive rate) was not controlled in these analyses, these analyses would generally not support conclusions about a treatment effect of the product on the individual components of the composite endpoint. In such a case, representing or suggesting that the data support such efficacy conclusions, either directly (e.g., by claiming the product has demonstrated efficacy on the individual components) or indirectly (e.g., by presenting p-values, which would imply a statistically rigorous conclusion where one does not exist), would be false or misleading.

Footnote 22: See, for example, FDA_ guidance _E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials_ (September 1998); FDA_ guidance _Design Considerations for Pivotal Clinical Investigations for Medical Devices_ (November 2013); and FDA_ guidance _Statistical Guidance on Reporting Results from Studies Evaluating Diagnostic Tests_ (March 2007).",Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff,"Question: What evidentiary support should a firm have for its CFL promotional communications?

The following are some high-level recommendations for firms to consider when developing their presentations of information in CFL promotional communications to help ensure the presentations do not mislead the applicable audience(s):

* Any study results or other data and information that are relied upon to support a firm's CFL promotional communication should be accurately represented in the communications. Moreover, aspects of study design and methodology that are material for audiences to accurately interpret the information presented (e.g. type of study, study objectives, product dosage/use regimens, controls used, patient population studied) from any studies relied on should be clearly and prominently25 disclosed in firms' CFL promotional communications, and material limitations related to the study design, methodology, and results should also be disclosed in a clear and prominent manner.
* The CFL promotional communication should accurately characterize and contextualize the relevant information about the product, including by disclosing unfavorable or inconsistent findings. For example, if a firm presents efficacy results from a postmarketing study of its product that evaluated the effect of the product on two different endpoints, such as overall survival and progression-free survival, and the product failed to demonstrate an effect on one of these two endpoints, the firm should clearly and prominently disclose this in the CFL promotional communication, rather than selectively presenting only the positive efficacy results.
* If the FDA-required labeling contains data or information related to what is being represented/suggested in the CFL promotional communication, the communication should also include the data or information from the FDA-required labeling to provide the audience with appropriate context, and this information should be presented in a clear and prominent way. For example, if a communication provides postmarketing information about the types and rates of occurrence of adverse events that have been observed in practice, the communication should also include information from the FDA-required labeling about the types and rates of occurrence of adverse reactions observed in clinical trials to provide context.",Guidance on Medical Device Patient Labeling Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff,"Question: What does FDA recommend that firms consider when developing CFL promotional communications that are consistent with the FDA-required labeling to help ensure that the presentation of this information does not render the communication false or misleading?

FDA considers appropriate risk factors, including considerations of animal and public health, in determining whether an animal drug product is safe and effective under particular conditions of use.

The safety and efficacy of Drug A for this indication was evaluated versus placebo treatment in a randomized, double-blind study. The study also included an active comparator (Drug B), approved for the same indication and with a comparable risk profile, which was similarly evaluated versus placebo. The study was not designed to test the non-inferiority or superiority of Drug A directly against Drug B (i.e., the Drug B arm was included for assay sensitivity). Drug A and Drug B demonstrated statistically significant improvements versus placebo in the co-primary efficacy endpoints, but Drug A's results showed a numerically greater improvement versus placebo than those for Drug B. Based on this study, Drug A's firm develops promotional materials to communicate that Drug A is clinically superior to Drug B for the long-term, maintenance treatment of asthma patients 12 years of age and older.
  Answer: If the data and information are accurately reported in the firm's promotional materials and the material aspects of the underlying study design and methodology are disclosed in the materials, including material limitations of the information, FDA would consider this to be truthful and non-misleading.

Expanded_Access_to_Investigational_Drugs_for_Treatment_Use_-_Questions_and_Answers_Guidance_for_Industry_JUNE_2016.mmd,"As described in Treatment Use of Investigational Drugs Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, What is expanded access?","The terms expanded access, access, and treatment use are used interchangeably to refer to use of an investigational drug when the primary purpose is to diagnose, monitor, or treat a patient's disease or condition. The terms _compassionate use_ and _preamproval access_ are also occasionally used in the context of the use of an investigational drug to treat a patient. Although these terms have been used informally in the United States and are used outside the United States, they are not defined or described in FDA regulations. This has led to some confusion or lack of clarity about the meaning of the terms (e.g., whether they refer to all expanded access or a type of expanded access, such as individual patient expanded access). For this reason, the terms _compassionate use_ and _preamproval access_ will not be used in this document.

The main distinction between expanded access and the use of an investigational drug in the usual studies covered under an IND is that expanded access uses are not primarily intended to obtain information about the safety or effectiveness of a drug. Expanded access to an investigational drug can only be provided under a treatment IND or protocol (see Q8) if the sponsor is actively pursuing, with due diligence, marketing approval of the drug for the expanded access use.

Expanded access, access, and treatment use may also refer to (1) use in situations when a drug has been withdrawn for safety reasons, but there exists a patient population for whom the benefits of the withdrawn drug continue to outweigh the risks; (2) use of a similar, but unapproved drug (e.g., foreign-approved drug product) to provide treatment during a drug shortage of the approved drug; (3) use of an approved drug where availability is limited by a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) for diagnostic, monitoring, or treatment purposes, by patients who cannot obtain the drug under the REMS; or (4) use for other reasons.",Treatment Use of Investigational Drugs Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators,"Question: What is expanded access?

**2) **Individual patient expanded access protocol** (also referred to as single patient protocol): Expanded access to an investigational drug for treatment use by a single patient submitted as a protocol to an existing IND by the sponsor of the existing IND. There is no 30-day period before treatment with the drug may begin, but the protocol must be submitted to FDA and have IRB approval consistent with 21 CFR part 56 (see 21 CFR 312.305(c)(4)) before treatment may begin. (See SSS 312.305(d)(2) and 312.30(a).)

**2a) Individual patient expanded access protocol for emergency use:** An emergency use protocol is a subset of individual patient protocols that provides expanded access to an investigational drug for treatment use by a single patient in an emergency situation (i.e., a situation that requires a patient to be treated before a written submission can be made) submitted as a protocol to an existing IND by the sponsor of the existing IND (21 CFR 312.310(d)). Treatment is initially requested and authorized by telephone (or other rapid means of communication)and may start immediately upon FDA authorization, with a requirement for a written submission (protocol) to FDA within 15 working days of the initial authorization (SS 312.310(d)(2)). In an emergency situation (either an emergency use IND or emergency use protocol) when there is not sufficient time to secure IRB review prior to beginning treatment, the emergency use of the investigational drug must be reported to the IRB within 5 working days of emergency use, as required under SS 56.104(c).

Expanded_Access_to_Investigational_Drugs_for_Treatment_Use_-_Questions_and_Answers_Guidance_for_Industry_JUNE_2016.mmd,"Based on the information from Treatment Use of Investigational Drugs Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators, Who can make a submission for individual patient expanded access?","The sponsor of an existing IND under which a drug is being developed (e.g., a pharmaceutical company or manufacturer of the investigational drug) or a licensed physician may make an individual patient expanded access submission (21 CFR 312.310(b)(1)).

The sponsor of an existing IND (e.g., a pharmaceutical company or manufacturer of the investigational drug) can submit an individual patient expanded access protocol to its existing IND. In this scenario, the sponsor of the existing IND is also the sponsor of the expanded access protocol, and the patient's physician is the investigator for the expanded access protocol. The term _investigator_ is used because the drug is investigational, but does not denote the physician's or patient's involvement in clinical research.

The sponsor of the existing IND can instead submit an individual patient expanded access IND and cross-reference information in its existing IND to support the individual patient expanded access IND. In this scenario, the sponsor of the existing IND is also the sponsor of the expanded access IND, and the patient's physician is the investigator for the expanded access IND.

Because having all clinical trials and expanded access use requests for a drug under a single IND may facilitate identification of safety concerns, ease the administrative burden for both sponsors and FDA, and will help in product review (if the drug is under development for marketing), it is preferable for sponsors to submit an individual patient expanded access protocol to an existing IND when possible.

A physician can submit an individual patient expanded access IND for his/her patient. In this scenario, when the patient's physician submits an expanded access IND, the physician is both the sponsor and the investigator--in other words, he or she is considered a sponsor-investigator (SS 312.305(c)(3)) for the purposes of part 312. The physician may satisfy some of the expandedaccess submission requirements by referring to information in an existing IND if the physician obtains permission from the sponsor of the existing IND (see Q5). If the physician obtains this permission from the sponsor of the existing IND, the physician should provide to FDA the LOA from the sponsor of the IND that permits FDA to reference the sponsor's IND.

In cases where it is not possible to obtain an LOA (e.g., the entity supplying the drug does not have an IND filed with FDA), physicians should contact the relevant FDA review division to determine what information is needed to support the expanded access submission. Physicians should also contact the review division if the individual patient expanded access IND is for an approved drug where availability is limited by a REMS. The physician should then submit an individual patient expanded access IND to the appropriate FDA review division and may choose to use Form FDA 3926.13 Contact information for review divisions may be found on FDA's Web site at

However, as reflected in SS 312.310(c)(1), FDA may authorize multiple courses of therapy or chronic therapy for individual patient expanded access, including authorizing individual patient expanded access to treat a chronic disease or condition that requires extended treatment. FDA generally authorizes such individual patient expanded access when the circumstances of the treatment are well defined and reasonable in light of the available evidence to support use of the drug. The patient's physician (as the investigator) proposes the full course of treatment when filing the request for expanded access. To fairly weigh the risks and benefits of a drug for use for individual patient expanded access, FDA believes the planned course of therapy should be well defined because it will usually be necessary to consider the planned dose and duration of therapy in relation to what is known about the occurrence of toxicity for that dose and duration of therapy. Therefore, FDA typically authorizes expanded access for an extended duration for the treatment of a chronic condition when the patient's condition and the information available about the safety of the drug support an extended duration of treatment, but FDA does not typically authorize expanded access for an unspecified duration at the discretion of the patient's physician. For example, FDA may authorize expanded access of extended duration for a drug being developed to treat multiple sclerosis or other types of progressively debilitating neuromuscular disease if it is critical that the drug be administered chronically to slow the progression of the disease and if the information available about the safety of the drug supports an extended duration of treatment.

This determination generally depends on the following two factors:_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_

1. _Whether the drug is under development for marketing for the expanded access use_

If the drug is not being developed for marketing and the expanded access IND or protocol is intended to treat more than a single patient, expanded access would be provided under an intermediate-size patient population expanded access. Expanded access to an investigational drug can only be provided under a treatment IND or protocol if the drug is being developed for marketing for the expanded access use. When the investigational drug is being developed, intermediate-size patient population expanded access is used earlier in development than treatment INDs or protocols. Also, if clinical development of the drug is essentially complete (i.e., the clinical trials to support marketing approval of the investigational drug have ended) and the intent of the expanded access is to bridge the gap (to ensure that treatment is not interrupted and to expand treatment to additional patients) between completion of the clinical trials and marketing of the drug, the expanded access, regardless of the number of patients expected to be treated, would generally be designated as a treatment IND or protocol.

2. _Size of the patient population_

The second factor important to a determination of whether expanded access is provided under an intermediate-size patient population expanded access (as opposed to a treatment IND or protocol) is the size of the patient population. In general, intermediate-size patient population expanded access is intended to accommodate population sizes smaller than the large populations typical of treatment INDs or protocols.

Generally, patients must be ineligible or otherwise unable (e.g., geographically unable to access a study site) to enter ongoing clinical trials to receive the drug under an expanded access IND or protocol. For all categories of expanded access, sponsors are required to include in their access submissions information adequate to demonstrate that expanded access to the drug will not interfere with clinical investigations or drug development, along with other information (SSSS 312.310(b), 312.315(c), and 312.320(b)).

FDA believes that expanded access INDs or protocols that treat larger patient populations generally have the greatest potential to interfere with clinical investigations or drug development, because of their greater potential to interfere with recruiting patients for the clinical investigation(s). FDA typically determines whether an expanded access use will interfere with clinical investigations or drug development based on the information provided by the sponsor in its expanded access submission. If the information provided by the sponsor is not adequate for FDA to make this determination, FDA may ask the sponsor for additional information.

For example, before authorizing a treatment IND for a drug for which clinical trials are ongoing, FDA may ask the sponsor to explain how the sponsor will ensure that the treatment IND will not interfere with accrual of patients in the clinical trials, and how the sponsor will determine whether interference is occurring, if such information is not provided in the expanded access submission. More specifically, FDA may ask the sponsor to submit to its IND a comprehensive investigational plan with a timetable and milestones (if it has not done so already) so that FDA can periodically assess whether the treatment IND is affecting accrual of patients in the clinical trials or other parameters related to the pace of drug development. If FDA then determines that the ongoing treatment IND is interfering with clinical trials or drug development or that the sponsor is not pursuing, with due diligence, marketing approval for the expanded access use, FDA could place the treatment IND on clinical hold (SS 312.42(b)(3)).",Treatment Use of Investigational Drugs Guidance for Institutional Review Boards and Clinical Investigators,"Question: How does FDA determine that authorizing expanded access to a drug will not interfere with clinical trials or drug development?

Your

proposed IVD study is exempt from most provisions of the IDE regulation if it fits any one of the following three categories:

a. The IVD is a pre-amendments device (i.e., a device that was in

commercial distribution prior to the enactment of the 1976 Medical

Device Amendments to the Act), other than a transitional device (see the

**Glossary** for definition), and is used or investigated according to the

indications in the labeling at that time.

b. The IVD is a device, other than a transitional device, that has been

found to be substantially equivalent to a pre-amendments device and is

used or investigated according to the indications in the labeling reviewed

by FDA in determining substantial equivalence.

c. The IVD

\({}^{\star}\) is properly labeled in accordance with 21 CFR 809.10(c);

\({}^{\star}\) is noninvasive (see question #5 below);

\({}^{\star}\) does not require an invasive sampling procedure that presents

significant risk (see question #4 below);

\({}^{\star}\) does not by design or intention introduce energy into a subject;

_and_\(\bullet\) is not used as a diagnostic procedure without confirmation of the diagnosis by another, medically established diagnostic product or procedure (see question # 6 below).

For your study to be exempt from most of the requirements of the IDE regulation under this third category, it must meet **all** of the conditions listed in ""c"" above. (See also the decision tree in Appendix 1.) You should refer to 21 CFR Parts 50 and 56 for applicable requirements relating to IRBs and informed consent, including for device studies that meet the criteria described in 21 CFR 812.2(c). Additionally, investigators for those studies are still subject to 21 CFR 812.119 (the provision entitled ""Disqualification of a clinical investigator."")

If your proposed study does not fit into one of the three categories listed above, you, the sponsor, must have an approved IDE (21 CFR 812.2) before you may begin your investigation, including any shipment of your investigational IVD. (Note: A device that is approved under a premarket approval application (PMA) or cleared under a 510(k) and then used in a study in accordance with the approved or cleared labeling is not investigational and, therefore, is not subject to the IDE regulation.)

The requirements for an IDE depend on the level of risk that the study presents to subjects.

For a significant risk device (see the **Glossary** for definition), the sponsor must apply to FDA for an IDE approval (see 21 CFR 812.1, 812.20). For a non-significant risk device (see the **Glossary** for definition), the sponsor must meet the abbreviated requirements of 21 CFR 812.2(b), including review and approval of the investigation by an institutional review board (IRB) and compliance with informed consent requirements. A non-significant risk study is considered to have an approved IDE when the abbreviated requirements are met.

**Note:** The requirements of the ""Protection of Human Subjects"" and ""Institutional Review Boards"" regulations (21 CFR Parts 50 and 56) apply to all clinical investigations regulated by FDA under section 520(g) of the Act, as well as other clinical investigations that support applications for research or marketing permits.

In_Vitro_Diagnostic_(IVD)_Device_Studies_-_Frequently_Asked_Questions_Guidance_for_Industry_and_FDA_Staff_JUNE_2010.mmd,"As described in Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff, How do I determine if the study is a significant or non-significant risk study under 21 CFR 812.2(b)?","A significant risk IVD device is generally one that is for a use of substantial importance in diagnosing, curing, mitigating, or treating disease, or otherwise preventing impairment of human health and presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety, or welfare of a subject or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to health, safety, or welfare of a subject. 21 CFR 812.3(m).

For IVDs, we interpret ""potential for serious risk"" in relation to the nature of the harm that may result to the subject. Misdiagnosis and/or error in treatment caused by inaccurate test results would be considered a significant risk if the potential harm to the subject could be life-threatening, or could result in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to the body structure.

False positive results can lead to unnecessary confirmatory testing, unnecessary treatment that can be invasive or have harmful side effects, and/or unnecessary psychological trauma when serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions are involved. False negative results can lead to a delay in establishing the correct diagnosis, failure to start or continue needed treatment, false security that may prevent timely follow-up and retesting, and contribute to the potential spread of infectious agents to others. If the potential risk does not rise to the level described above, the study is not considered to pose a significant risk.

FDA recognizes that there are circumstances when an unapproved or uncleared IVD is the only available option for a patient or small group of patients who do not meet the inclusion criteria and ""compassionate use""/single patient use of the device may be appropriate. Section 561 of the Act. CBER refers to such situations as ""single patient exemptions."" Appropriate patient protection measures are needed for these studies.

Use of an investigational IVD device for one or a small group of patients who do not meet the study inclusion criteria would require a change to the investigational plan. 21 CFR 812.35(a). If the study is being conducted under an approved IDE, the sponsor should submit a supplement to the IDE requesting a change to the investigational plan for ""compassionate use."" 21 CFR 812.35(a). The review of this supplement can be facilitated by a phone call to the reviewing division and by the submission by facsimile of an advanced copy of the supplement. If the investigational IVD device would require an FDA-approved IDE, but one has not yet been submitted or approved, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion where the sponsor submits a compassionate use request to CDRH or CBER, as appropriate, and follows the patient protection measures listed above for emergency use.4

Food and Drug Administration",Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff,"Question: Can an unapproved or uncleared investigational IVD device ever be used for nonemergency treatment of patients who do not meet the inclusion criteria of an investigational study?
  Answer: Yes, in exceptional situations. FDA recognizes that there are circumstances when an unapproved or uncleared IVD is the only available option for a patient or small group of patients who do not meet the inclusion criteria and ""compassionate use""/single patient use of the device may be appropriate. Section 561 of the Act. CBER refers to such situations as ""single patient exemptions."" Appropriate patient protection measures are needed for these studies.

Use of an investigational IVD device for one or a small group of patients who do not meet the study inclusion criteria would require a change to the investigational plan. 21 CFR 812.35(a). If the study is being conducted under an approved IDE, the sponsor should submit a supplement to the IDE requesting a change to the investigational plan for ""compassionate use."" 21 CFR 812.35(a). The review of this supplement can be facilitated by a phone call to the reviewing division and by the submission by facsimile of an advanced copy of the supplement. If the investigational IVD device would require an FDA-approved IDE, but one has not yet been submitted or approved, FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion where the sponsor submits a compassionate use request to CDRH or CBER, as appropriate, and follows the patient protection measures listed above for emergency use.4

If a study is being conducted according to an exemption under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3), or as a non-significant risk IDE under 21 CFR 812.2(b), the sponsor should obtain prior approval for the specific compassionate use/single patient use for the individual(s) in question from the FDA and the reviewing IRB at the site where the physician proposes to use the device.

Evidence from well-controlled investigations, partially controlled studies, studies and objective trials without matched controls, well-documented case histories conducted by qualified experts, and reports of significant human experience with a marketed device, from which it can fairly and responsibly be concluded by qualified experts that there is reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of a device under its conditions of use (21 CFR 860.7(c)(2)).

The intended use of the IVD, the level and quality of information in the literature relevant to the device use, and FDA knowledge of the technology obtained from reviewing other premarket applications determine the type of study and the level of evidence you may need to demonstrate reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness. For example, if you are studying an IVD device that uses a well-characterized technology and has an intended use that falls within a type of device that has been classified into Class I or Class II, the study may consist of a comparison of analytic performance to that of a legally marketed (i.e., predicate) device. On the other hand, if your IVD uses novel or unproven technology or has a new intended use, you may need to conduct a well-planned clinical study of the device in the target population defined by your intended use. You may contact the Division in the appropriate Center if you have questions regarding the type of study you need to conduct for your device.

We recommend that sponsors and investigators of all studies, including exempt studies under 21 CFR 812.2(c)(3), conduct the studies with the following goals in mind: producing valid scientific evidence of the product's safety and effectiveness and protecting the rights and welfare of study subjects.

Records should contain sufficient detail to allow the study to be reproduced when the same protocol is followed. We recommend that investigators maintain detailed records because a review of the study may indicate the need for other analyses of the collected data.

We also recommend that investigators:

a. Maintain records of all data elements captured in the study, including raw measurements and subject co-variables in the form of demographic and morbidity factors; b. Link every observation recorded to the subject and that person's co-variable data; c. Preserve information obtained for all subjects enrolled and for all specimens collected.

Additionally, electronic spreadsheets of study data are useful.

http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm126402.htm.",Assay Migration Studies for In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff,"Question: What records should help to ensure scientific soundness of an IVD investigational study?
  Answer: Unless a study falls within the exemption at 21 CFR 812.2(c), specific record requirements are listed in 21 CFR 812.140. In general, the records that are needed are those that provide the data for testing the study hypotheses. Records should contain sufficient detail to allow the study to be reproduced when the same protocol is followed. We recommend that investigators maintain detailed records because a review of the study may indicate the need for other analyses of the collected data.

We also recommend that investigators:

a. Maintain records of all data elements captured in the study, including raw measurements and subject co-variables in the form of demographic and morbidity factors; b. Link every observation recorded to the subject and that person's co-variable data; c. Preserve information obtained for all subjects enrolled and for all specimens collected.

Additionally, electronic spreadsheets of study data are useful.

The suggested format for the IDE final report, which FDA includes as an enclosure in all IDE approval letters, is found in Appendix 5 of this guidance.

It should be noted that FDA will consider submission of a marketing application (510(k), PMA, or HDE) to serve as the final report for the IDE. When a study sponsor submits a marketing application in lieu of the final report, the sponsor should still submit a supplement to the IDE stating that the marketing application should be considered the final report for the study.

In addition, laboratories that develop tests using ASRs must be in compliance with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA), 42 U.S.C. 263a 62 FR 62252.",Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff,"Question: What was the objective of the ASR rule?
  Answer: The ASR rule was designed to accomplish several policy objectives. One of the primary goals of the rule was to ensure the quality of the primary, active reagents of finished IVDs or LDTs. Another focus of the rule is the requirement for appropriate labeling to be appended to test results when ASRs are used by clinical laboratories in LDTs, so that healthcare users can understand when tests are being developed and validated by the laboratory and have not undergone FDA clearance or approval. 62 FR 62244.

trial,"" and provides a discussion of the current thinking on the meaning of the term at

http://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/fdaaa.html.

What clinical trials are specifically excluded from the definition of ""applicable clinical trials?""

For **devices**, small feasibility trials and larger clinical trials of prototype devices with a primary measure of feasibility rather than health outcomes are not applicable clinical trials. 42 U.S.C. SS 282(j)(1)(A)(ii). Under current guidance contained on NIH's website at http://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/ElaborationsOnDefinitions.pdf, a device trial is not an applicable device clinical trial when the trial includes only de-identified human specimens and does not include ""human subjects"" (a requirement to be considered an applicable clinical trial). The website states: ""For purposes only of the requirements under 402(j) of the PHS Act, this definition of human subject does not apply to de-identified human specimens. (See, Guidance on Informed Consent for In Vitro Diagnostic Device Studies Using Leftover Human Specimens that are Not Individually Identifiable, April 25, 2006 http://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm127022.htm)

For **drugs**, phase 1 clinical investigations (defined in 21 C.F.R. SS 312.21) are not categorized as ""applicable clinical trials."" 42 U.S.C. SS 282(j)(1)(A)(iii). Uncontrolled clinical investigations of drugs or devices also are not considered ""applicable clinical trials.""

E5 addresses primarily how development programs in one or two regions might support approval in another region. E5 says, in general, that if the data developed in one region satisfy the requirements for evidence in a new region, but there is a concern about possible intrinsic or extrinsic ethnic differences between the two regions, then it should be possible to extrapolate the data to the new region with a single bridging study. The bridging study could be a pharmacodynamic study or a full clinical trial, possibly a dose-response study. The bridging study would allow extrapolation of an adequate database to the new region. It would seem possible, and efficient, to assess potential regional differences as part of a global development program, i.e., for development of data to occur simultaneously in various regions, rather than sequentially. For example, if multi-regional trials had a sufficient number of trial subjects from the new region, it might be possible to analyze the impact of ethnic differences in those studied, to determine whether the entire database is pertinent to the new region. The basic issues to be considered in a global study design that could affect a region's willingness to rely on these data are: (a) definition and diagnoses of disease condition and patient, (b) choice of control group, (c) regional target or objective of treatment with choice of efficacy variables, (d) methods of assessment of safety, (e) medical practice, (f) duration of the trial, (g) regional concomitant medications, (h) severity distribution of eligible subjects, and (i) similarity of dose and dose regimens.

In our response, we stated that the revised labels were to be displayed on food products that are initially introduced into interstate commerce on or after the compliance date, and said we would address the issue further in guidance. We received a number of questions about products at various points in the distribution chain and whether the product would need to bear the new version of the Nutrition or Supplement Facts label.

chapter-1-general.mmd,This question is about Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels  Can I use Brix values to calculate the added sugars declaration for a product containing juice concentrates?,"We use Brix values to calculate the labeled percentage of juice from concentrate found in a juice or juice beverage using the minimum Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30. We have determined that single strength (100 percent) juice contains at least the specified minimum Brix for each single strength juice listed in 21 CFR 101.30. For a juice concentrate, the added sugars are those that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. Therefore, to calculate the added sugars in the concentrated juice ingredient, you need to know the amount of sugars in the 100 percent juice (i.e. single strength juice) of the same type. This may be obtained in several ways. For example, if you know the sugar content of the single strength fruit juice before it is concentrated and added to the product, because the amount of sugar from the single strength juice has been determined through chemical analysis, you may use the known sugar content when calculating and determining the added sugars declaration. You also may choose to use the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 as an estimate of the sugar content of the single strength juice. We recognize that industry uses the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1) when reconstituting juices as the minimum Brix that the 100 percent juice must have to meet. We understand that to account for process variability, industry may reconstitute to a slightly higher Brix to ensure that the 100 percent juice product consistently meet the minimum juice soluble solids requirements of 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1). Based on the information we have available to us, we would expect that the slight overage of juice soluble solids above the minimum Brix value used to account for process variability is small and would be consistent with our Current Good Manufacturing Practices3 (cGMPs). Therefore, we would not expect such slight overages to be included in the declaration of added sugars. However, if a product is designed to achieve a higher juice soluble solids concentration than what is required by the minimum Brix value for 100% juice (e.g., to increase sweetness) and the excess is above the cGMP variations described above, the amount of sugars that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type are added sugars, and must be declared as such as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule (also see Q&A 11 and 12). We require that, when a mixture of naturally occurring and added sugars is present in the food, a manufacturer must make and keep written records of the amount of added sugars added to the food during the processing of the food, and if packaged as a separate ingredient, as packaged (whether as part of a package containing one or more ingredients or packaged as a single ingredient) (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)(iv)). If you use Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 to calculate the amount of added sugars in a product containing juice concentrate, you must document this information in the records regarding the amount of added sugars added to the food during processing (21 CFR 101.9(g)(10)). If you use the amount of sugars present in a single strength juice and/or a juice concentrate, that is determined through chemical analysis or other available information, when calculating the amount of added sugars in a product containing fruit juice concentrate, you must document the source of the information and/or the amount of sugars determined through chemical analysis in the records that you make and keep (21 CFR 101.9(c)(6)(iii)). If a diluted juice concentrate slightly exceeds the amount of sugar that would be found in the same volume of the same type of 100 percent fruit juice, manufacturers should document the average and consistency with cGMPs in the records that they make and keep.",Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels ,"Question: Can I use Brix values to calculate the added sugars declaration for a product containing juice concentrates?
  Answer: We use Brix values to calculate the labeled percentage of juice from concentrate found in a juice or juice beverage using the minimum Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30. We have determined that single strength (100 percent) juice contains at least the specified minimum Brix for each single strength juice listed in 21 CFR 101.30. For a juice concentrate, the added sugars are those that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. Therefore, to calculate the added sugars in the concentrated juice ingredient, you need to know the amount of sugars in the 100 percent juice (i.e. single strength juice) of the same type. This may be obtained in several ways. For example, if you know the sugar content of the single strength fruit juice before it is concentrated and added to the product, because the amount of sugar from the single strength juice has been determined through chemical analysis, you may use the known sugar content when calculating and determining the added sugars declaration. You also may choose to use the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30 as an estimate of the sugar content of the single strength juice. We recognize that industry uses the Brix values provided in 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1) when reconstituting juices as the minimum Brix that the 100 percent juice must have to meet. We understand that to account for process variability, industry may reconstitute to a slightly higher Brix to ensure that the 100 percent juice product consistently meet the minimum juice soluble solids requirements of 21 CFR 101.30(h)(1). Based on the information we have available to us, we would expect that the slight overage of juice soluble solids above the minimum Brix value used to account for process variability is small and would be consistent with our Current Good Manufacturing Practices3 (cGMPs). Therefore, we would not expect such slight overages to be included in the declaration of added sugars. However, if a product is designed to achieve a higher juice soluble solids concentration than what is required by the minimum Brix value for 100% juice (e.g., to increase sweetness) and the excess is above the cGMP variations described above, the amount of sugars that are in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type are added sugars, and must be declared as such as required by our Nutrition Facts label final rule (also see Q&A 11 and 12).

Juice (fruit or vegetable) ingredients are unique in that the amount of added sugars from the juice ingredient depends on whether the juice ingredient is concentrated, and thus, contains sugar in excess of what would be expected from the same volume of 100 percent juice of the same type. We realize that food formulation is complex and manufacturers can use different ingredients or alternative formulas to achieve the same finished product composition. For example, you may use 100% fruit juice and dry sugar in a baking application. You also may have an alternative formulation that uses concentrated fruit juice and liquid syrup to achieve the same product composition. When water or other wet ingredients containing water (e.g. milk, syrup, egg, diluted wines and cider with less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, etc.) are added to a formulation containing concentrated juice and other ingredients during processing, the amount of moisture that goes towards reconstituting the juice or towards wetting or reconstituting other ingredients is not known. Furthermore, if the water added during formulation is divided among the ingredients when determining the amount of reconstitution or wetting that has occurred, different formulations of the same finished food could have different calculated added sugar amounts. Therefore, we considered an approach that we believe would provide a reasonable estimate of the added sugars content of a multi-ingredient product that includes concentrated fruit juice as an ingredient (e.g. a bakery product, marinade, or diluted wines and cider with less than 7 percent alcohol by volume). When concentrated juices are used in the formulation, we believe that it is practical to use all of the moisture in the formulation towards reconstitution of the concentrated juice when calculating the amount of added sugars in a serving of the product. It is also possible that the initial juice ingredient in the formulation (either diluted, 100%, or concentrated) is further concentrated during processing due to loss of water (e.g., during drying or baking). Because the amount of added sugars is based on the finished product composition, you should account for the loss of water during processing to reflect the concentration of the juice ingredient after processing. Considering the complexity of food formulation and processing, we believe it is also appropriate to use the moisture content of the finished product towards reconstitution of the juice soluble solids when the product is subject to water loss during processing.

chapter-1-general.mmd,"Drawing from the insights of Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Can you provide an example demonstrating the calculation of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?","To demonstrate the general approach described above, we provide two hypothetical examples below. In these hypothetical examples, we use the Brix value as an estimate for the sugar concentration.

Hypothetical example 1:

A product formulation contains a single juice ingredient (5% apple juice at 70 Brix value). The finished product has a serving size of 250 gm and a moisture content of 50%.

Step 1: The amount of total sugars in the juice ingredient = weight per serving \(\times\) percentage apple juice concentrate \(\times\) % sugar in apple juice concentrate = 250 g \(\times\) 5% \(\times\) 70% = 8.75 g.

Step 2: The water content or the moisture content of the finished product = weight per serving \(\times\) moisture content = 250 g \(\times\) 50% = 125 g.

Step 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = 8.75 g / 125 g = 7%.

Because 7% is less than the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength apple juice (11.5 Brix value), the added sugar from the apple juice ingredient in this hypothetical example is zero even though the starting ingredient is a concentrated apple juice.

Hypothetical example 2 (with drying step where water is removed):_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_

A product formulation contains a single juice ingredient (20% single strength apple juice at 11.5 Brix) in the wet formulation (prior to drying). The blended wet formulation has a water content of 50% (i.e., a solids content of 50%). The product goes through a drying step. The finished product has a water content of 10% (i.e., a solids content of 90%) and a serving size of 40 g.

Step 1: The amount of total sugars contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving.

Because there is water loss during manufacturing, in this method we calculate the amount of wet formulation needed to yield 40 g serving size finished product.

* Solids content in the finished product g = 40 x 90% = 36 g.
* Because the solids prior to drying is 50% (moisture = 50%), the starting wet formulation prior to drying that yielded the 40 g serving size finished product is 72 g (36 g / 50%).
* The amount of total sugar contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving (based on wet formulation weight percentage) = 72 g \(\times\) 20% \(\times\) 11.5% = 1.656 g.

Step 2: The water content of the finished product = weight per serving \(\times\)moisture content = 40 g \(\times\) 10% = 4 g.

Step 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = (1.656 g/ 4 g) \(\times\) 100 = 41.4%.",Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels ,"Question: Can you provide an example demonstrating the calculation of added sugars from a juice ingredient in a multi-ingredient formulation?

Step 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = 8.75 g / 125 g = 7%.

Because 7% is less than the sugar concentration in the theoretical single strength apple juice (11.5 Brix value), the added sugar from the apple juice ingredient in this hypothetical example is zero even though the starting ingredient is a concentrated apple juice.

The finished product has a water content of 10% (i.e., a solids content of 90%) and a serving size of 40 g.

Step 1: The amount of total sugars contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving.

Because there is water loss during manufacturing, in this method we calculate the amount of wet formulation needed to yield 40 g serving size finished product.

* Solids content in the finished product g = 40 x 90% = 36 g.
* Because the solids prior to drying is 50% (moisture = 50%), the starting wet formulation prior to drying that yielded the 40 g serving size finished product is 72 g (36 g / 50%).
* The amount of total sugar contributed by the apple juice ingredient per serving (based on wet formulation weight percentage) = 72 g \(\times\) 20% \(\times\) 11.5% = 1.656 g.

Step 2: The water content of the finished product = weight per serving \(\times\)moisture content = 40 g \(\times\) 10% = 4 g.

Step 3: The apple juice sugar concentration if we assume all of the water in the finished product is used to reconstitute the apple juice = (1.656 g/ 4 g) \(\times\) 100 = 41.4%.

chapter-1-general.mmd,"Based on the information from Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels , Some ingredients contain mono- and disaccharides (DP1 and DP2 (one and two degrees of polymerization)) that are created through processes such as hydrolysis. Do the mono- and disaccharide portions of ingredients that are created through hydrolysis need to be declared as added sugars on the label?","In the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33832), we said that, other than sugar syrup types of products where the sugars are specifically and purposely produced via hydrolysis, we do not have information suggesting that sugars produced through incidental hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates results in significant increase in the sugar content of foods. We did not receive any comments or other information suggesting that these sugars should be captured under the added sugars declaration, and we did not include sugars produced through incidental hydrolysis in our definition of added sugars (id.). Therefore, such sugars would not be declared as added sugars on the label. We also explained that if a manufacturer purposely employs a hydrolysis step as part of a food manufacturing process to increase the sugar content of a food product (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch to make corn syrup in the same facility as part of the cookie-making process), we would consider the sugar generated from the hydrolysis step to be added sugars, since hydrolysis was purposely used by the manufacturer to increase the sugar content of the product (id.).

In the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33835), we also said that, in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Report (2015 DGAC Report).

Manufacturers may purposely employ methods, such as hydrolysis, for a number of reasons, some of which result in an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides with DP1 and DP2. Ingredients such as maltodextrin and corn syrup solids are hydrolyzed to achieve various degrees of dextrose equivalence (DE). The higher the DE, the lower the degree of polymerization, and the sweeter the ingredient becomes. Maltodext (21 CFR 184.1444) are ingredients with a DE less than 20, and corn syrup (21 CFR 168.120, 168.121, and 184.1865) are ingredients with a DE of 20 or higher. Depending on the manufacturing process, different maltodextrin and corn syrup will have different DE and different amounts of mono- and disaccharides. Although maltodext are not used primarily for sweetening purposes, depending on the DE, some can contain 8-9% mono and disaccharides and can contribute to sweetness. We also understand that the hydrolysis process to manufacture maltodextrin and corn syrup are controlled so that the desired DE can be consistently achieved. This indicates that some maltodext and corn syrup solids are manufactured purposely to contain certain levels of mono- and disaccharides. Information that is publicly available (e.g., online product specification sheets and reference materials) indicates that manufacturers have knowledge of the level of mono- and disaccharides created during the processing of ingredients through controlled hydrolysis.

Maltodext, corn syrups, and other ingredients with mono-and disaccharides that are created through controlled hydrolysis are widely used by manufacturers and are present in many different types of food products (47 FR 36443 at 36444, September 20, 1982). The sugars contributed by these ingredients are consistent with the concept of empty calories as described in the 2015 DGAC Report because they supply sugars and calories to the diet when they are added as an ingredient to foods. We explained in the Nutrition Facts label final rule that small amounts of added sugars that are contributed to the diet by a wide variety of foods can add up over the course of the day and can make it difficult for an individual to eat sufficient amounts of foods from the basic food groups to meet nutrient needs without exceeding the amount of calories they need in a day for weight maintenance (81 FR 33742 at 33759). As such, when an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides that are created through controlled hydrolysis (e.g. maltodextrin or corn syrup) is added to a food during processing, those mono- and disaccharides contributed by the ingredient need to be declared as added sugars on the label (21 CFR 101.9(c)(9)(iii).",Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels ,"Question: Some ingredients contain mono- and disaccharides (DP1 and DP2 (one and two degrees of polymerization)) that are created through processes such as hydrolysis. Do the mono- and disaccharide portions of ingredients that are created through hydrolysis need to be declared as added sugars on the label?
  Answer: In the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33832), we said that, other than sugar syrup types of products where the sugars are specifically and purposely produced via hydrolysis, we do not have information suggesting that sugars produced through incidental hydrolysis of complex carbohydrates results in significant increase in the sugar content of foods. We did not receive any comments or other information suggesting that these sugars should be captured under the added sugars declaration, and we did not include sugars produced through incidental hydrolysis in our definition of added sugars (id.). Therefore, such sugars would not be declared as added sugars on the label. We also explained that if a manufacturer purposely employs a hydrolysis step as part of a food manufacturing process to increase the sugar content of a food product (e.g. enzymatic hydrolysis of corn starch to make corn syrup in the same facility as part of the cookie-making process), we would consider the sugar generated from the hydrolysis step to be added sugars, since hydrolysis was purposely used by the manufacturer to increase the sugar content of the product (id.).

In the preamble to the Nutrition Facts label final rule (81 FR 33742 at 33835), we also said that, in determining which sugars should be included in the definition of added sugars, we have considered the presence of added sugars as a component of dietary intake and whether it is consistent with the concept of empty calories, as discussed in the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee Report (2015 DGAC Report).

Manufacturers may purposely employ methods, such as hydrolysis, for a number of reasons, some of which result in an ingredient containing mono- and disaccharides with DP1 and DP2. Ingredients such as maltodextrin and corn syrup solids are hydrolyzed to achieve various degrees of dextrose equivalence (DE). The higher the DE, the lower the degree of polymerization, and the sweeter the ingredient becomes. Maltodext (21 CFR 184.1444) are ingredients with a DE less than 20, and corn syrup (21 CFR 168.120, 168.121, and 184.1865) are ingredients with a DE of 20 or higher. Depending on the manufacturing process, different maltodextrin and corn syrup will have different DE and different amounts of mono- and disaccharides. Although maltodext are not used primarily for sweetening purposes, depending on the DE, some can contain 8-9% mono and disaccharides and can contribute to sweetness. We also understand that the hydrolysis process to manufacture maltodextrin and corn syrup are controlled so that the desired DE can be consistently achieved.

The sugars in dairy ingredients, except lactose as defined in 21 CFR 168.122, are not included in the definition of added sugars. Moreover, lactose that meets our standard of identity is an added sugar.

Lactose, as a sugar in a dairy product, is a disaccharide that is captured on the Nutrition Facts label under the Total Sugars declaration. However, lactose that meets the definition in 21 CFR 168.122 is captured on the Nutrition Facts label under both the Added Sugars and Total Sugars declarations. We are aware that the enzyme lactase is used by industry to hydrolyze lactose present in dairy products for the purposes of reducing the lactose content in low-lactose dairy products. The hydrolysis of lactose results in the monosaccharides glucose and galactose. Regardless of whether hydrolysis of lactose, present in dairy products or in dairy ingredients by lactase is being utilized to reduce lactose or to increase the sweetness of the product, hydrolysis of lactose under such circumstances does not result in an increase in sugars that would affect the Total Sugars declaration. Moreover, to the extent lactose that meets our standard of identity in 21 CFR 168.122 is subject to hydrolysis, the Added Sugars declaration would be the same before and after the hydrolysis of such a lactose ingredient using lactase. Since the hydrolysis of lactose found in dairy products (e.g. milk) and dairy ingredients (e.g. stabilizers and texturizers), and the hydrolysis of lactose that meets our standard of identity, do not result in an increase in the Total Sugars declaration, the hydrolysis process also does not result in an increase in the caloric content of the food. Thus, the sugars created through enzymatic hydrolysis of lactose, whether present as a component of a dairy product, a dairy ingredient, or contributed by the addition of lactose that meets the definition in 21 CFR 168.122, do not change the declarations for Total Sugars or Added Sugars for the product.",Guidance for Industry- FDA's Policy on Declaring Small Amounts of Nutrients and Dietary Ingredients on Nutrition Labels ,"Question: Does the sugar created through enzymatic hydrolysis of lactose in low-lactose dairy products need to be declared as added sugars?

(2) Regulatory status for antioxidant ingredients and substances;

(3) Safety considerations;

(4) Common chemical assays used for determination of antioxidant activity;

(5) Expert opinions on availability and efficacy of test methods for assessing antioxidant activity; and

(6) The substance's biological and physiological familiarity and characteristics.

S7B Nonclinical Evaluation of the Potential for Delayed Ventricular Repolarization (QT Interval Prolongation) by Human Pharmaceuticals , The ICH E14 guidance states that QT interval corrected by Friderica's and Bazett's correction should be submitted in all applications; is this still necessary? Is there a recommended approach to QT correction that is different from that specified in the ICH E14 guidance? (1.5)","Changes in heart rate could variably influence a drug's effect on repolarization (i.e., QT interval), and correction methods with different characteristics are often applied. The principles set below would be applicable in all clinical studies (thorough QT or other studies).

In adults, Bazett's correction has been clearly shown to be an inferior method of correcting for differences in heart rate among and within subjects. Therefore, QT interval data corrected using Bazett's corrections is no longer warranted in all applications unless there is a compelling reason for a comparison to historical Bazett's corrected QT data. Presentation of data with a Friderica's correction is likely to be appropriate in most situations, but other methods could be more appropriate. There is no single recommended alternative (see E14 Q&A Q4 (1.4) on Incorporating New Technologies), but the following are some considerations:

1. Analyses of the same data using different models for correcting QT can generate discordant results. Therefore, it is important that the method(s) of correction, criteria for the selection of the method of correction, and rationale for the components of the method of correction be specified prior to analysis to limit bias. Model selection should be based on objective criteria and should consider the uncertainty in parameter estimates. Alternative methods of correction should be used only if the primary method fails the prespecified criteria for selection of the method of correction.

S7B Nonclinical Evaluation of the Potential for Delayed Ventricular Repolarization (QT Interval Prolongation) by Human Pharmaceuticals ","Question: The ICH E14 guidance states that QT interval corrected by Friderica's and Bazett's correction should be submitted in all applications; is this still necessary? Is there a recommended approach to QT correction that is different from that specified in the ICH E14 guidance? (1.5)
  Answer: Changes in heart rate could variably influence a drug's effect on repolarization (i.e., QT interval), and correction methods with different characteristics are often applied. The principles set below would be applicable in all clinical studies (thorough QT or other studies).

In adults, Bazett's correction has been clearly shown to be an inferior method of correcting for differences in heart rate among and within subjects. Therefore, QT interval data corrected using Bazett's corrections is no longer warranted in all applications unless there is a compelling reason for a comparison to historical Bazett's corrected QT data. Presentation of data with a Friderica's correction is likely to be appropriate in most situations, but other methods could be more appropriate.

(4.2)","Adjustment for baseline measurements is potentially useful for several purposes, including detection of carry-over effects, reducing the influence of inter-subject differences, and accounting for diurnal effects such as those due to food. There is no single best approach for baseline adjustment, but all planned baseline computations should be prospectively defined in the clinical trial protocol. Two kinds of baseline are commonly used: _time-matched_ baseline (taken at exactly the same time-points on the day prior to the beginning of treatment as on the treatment day) and _predose_ baseline (taken shortly prior to dosing). The _predose_ baseline is usedfor adjustment for inter-subject differences but not for diurnal effects. The choice of baseline is influenced by whether the study is parallel or crossover.

For a parallel-group study, a time-matched baseline allows the detection of differences in diurnal patterns between subjects that would not be detected by a predose baseline. In a parallel study, a _time-matched_ baseline day, if performed, would ideally occur on the day before the start of the study.

In contrast, in a crossover study, a time-matched baseline is usually not necessary because adjustments for subject- and study-specific diurnal variation are implicit by design in the assessment of time-matched drug-placebo differences in QT/QTc effect. The _predose_ baseline, therefore, is usually adequate for crossover studies.

It is important to recognize that the timing of the QT assessment relative to peak drug concentrations or to the time of adverse effects or sudden death cannot always be known prospectively. Accordingly, interpretation of the data should also consider the relationship between the observed effect on the QTc interval and the timing of adverse events or proarrhythmic events observed during clinical development or in marketed use. It is appropriate to integrate these factors to inform judgment regarding the significance of the observed QT prolongation.

(7.3)","QTc prolongation in a control arm within a non-conventional design clinical study should be considered in the context of clinical proarrhythmic events observed in clinical development or in marketed use. Comparison to placebo in a randomized controlled study provides valuable information. However, the placebo effect on QTc should not be discounted. Current understanding is that in many, but not all, studies a small mean QTc increasing effect compared to placebo has been observed. The placebo effect on QTc cannot be definitively quantified as it may be variable in size and difficult to distinguish from normal assay or population variability. The typical magnitude of the placebo effect on QTc appears to be small (i.e., 1 to 3 msec) at clinically effective doses and is reduced at higher doses. Comparison of differences in site, observer, or equipment characteristics may be less important in placebo-controlled studies in assessing the overall drug effect. Data from placebo-controlled studies conducted in compliance with ICH E14 and S5(R3) guidance and including the same electrocardiographic endpoint, assessment time, and quality standards for concomitant drug use, show that the QT/QTc prolonging effect of most QTc-prolonging drugs falls within an interval of less than 10 msec compared to placebo. In a diversity of therapeutic areas and with many different drugs and doses tested, QT effects near 0.5% of the mean-used global average heart rate were typically >10 msec, and in general, compounds with a mean maximum prolongation of the QTc interval of 5 msec versus placebo were estimated to prolong the QTc interval by up to 15 msec with 90% probability. For this reason, a difference of 5 msec between a QT/QTc drug effect and placebo can still be judged as within the expected 90% upper confidence interval for the placebo difference, even if not determined with high precision. In a given clinical development, the magnitude of the placebo effect on QTc may be as much as 6 or 7 msec.

S7B Nonclinical Evaluation of the Potential for Delayed Ventricular Repolarization (QT Interval Prolongation) by Human Pharmaceuticals , What is the recommended method to compute the hERG safety margin? (1.2)","A drug's potency for hERG block, usually calculated as half-inhibitory concentration (IC50), can be normalized to the drug's estimated clinically relevant exposures in patients to calculate the safety margin. As more information is obtained during the clinical development, the estimated values of clinical exposures can be refined. When estimating hERG block potency, it is recommended to use standardized procedures and to consider the principles described in S7B Q&A Q19 (2.1).

The free drug exposure is computed based on the drug's total plasma concentration and the fraction of protein binding. Because of uncertainties in the protein binding measurements, the unbound (free) fraction in plasma should be set to 1% if experimentally determined to be \(<1\%\). This approach has been used in the regulatory assessment for the risk of drug- drug interactions. If protein binding values cannot be accurately assessed (e.g., questionable validation of the bioanalytical method, deviations from best practices), safety margins should be calculated for both steady-state free and total C\({}_{\text{max}}\).

In terms of the exposure to use in the denominator of the safety margin calculation for supporting decision-making under ICH E14 Q&As Q12 (5.1) or Q13 (6.1), it is generally recommended that the high clinical exposure be used as defined in ICH E14 Q&A Q12 (5.1) (i.e., mean steady-state maximum concentration (C\({}_{\text{max,ss}}\)) when the maximum therapeutic dose is administered in the presence of the intrinsic or extrinsic factor that has the largest effect on increasing C\({}_{\text{max,ss}}\)).

To assess whether the hERG block poses a risk of delaying ventricular repolarization or TdP, the resulting safety margin should be compared to the range of safety margins computed under the same experimental protocol for a series of reference drugs that have known clinical TdP risk and cover diverse electrophysiological properties. Additional pharmacological principles or modeling can be used to justify the use of a certain safety margin threshold (e.g., relationshipbetween hERG block and QTc prolongation from semi-mechanistic

pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models or systems pharmacology models; see Leishman et al. 2020,7 for examples). This should be supported by experimental data based on the principles in these S7B Q&As (e.g., same experimental protocol applied to a series of drugs with known clinical TdP risk).

(3.1)","The positive control in a study is used to test the study's ability (its _assay sensitivity_ ) to detect the study endpoint of interest, in this case QT prolongation by about 5 ms. If the study is able to detect such QT prolongation by the control, then a finding of no QT effect of that size for the test drug will constitute evidence that the test drug does not, in fact, prolong the QT interval by the amount of regulatory concern. There are two conditions required for ensuring such assay sensitivity:

1. The positive control should show a significant increase in QTc, i.e., the lower bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) must be above 0 ms. This shows that the trial is capable of detecting an increase in QTc, a conclusion that is essential to concluding that a negative finding for the test drug is meaningful.
2. The study should be able to detect an effect of about 5 ms (the QTc threshold of regulatory concern) if it is present. Therefore, the size of the effect of the positive control is of particular relevance. With this aim, there are at least two approaches: 1. To use a positive control showing an effect of greater than 5 ms (i.e., lower bound of a one-sided 95% CI \(>\) 5 ms). This approach has proven to be useful in many regulatory cases. However, if the positive control has too large an effect, the study's ability to detect a 5 ms QTc prolongation might be questioned. In this situation, the effect of the positive control could be examined at times other than the peak effect to determine whether an effect close to the threshold of regulatory concern can be detected. 2.

Is there a threshold at which we would not be expected to confirm the COA results?","If the elemental impurity content listed on the COA will lead to a daily exposure that is not more than 30% of the PDE for an element, the risk from the component can usually be considered below the threshold at which additional testing by the drug product manufacturer is necessary (see Appendix I), and confirmation of the COA values for elemental impurities will not be requested. If the 30% control threshold will be applied, the total daily exposure should not exceed 30% of the PDE in cases where the same element may be introduced by multiple components of the drug product.

If the 30% threshold is exceeded but the elements are below the PDE, the drug product manufacturer should confirm the component COA results for vendor qualification, or, alternatively, test every lot of the drug product to ensure that the element does not exceed the PDE.

The titles only consist of the word ""Estradiol"" followed by a series of ""1""s, which doesn't give any specific information about their content., What is the background of this guidance?","The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA)3 requires all Federal agencies to assess the environmental impact of their actions and to ensure that the interested and affected public is informed of the environmental analyses. To comply with NEPA, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers the environmental impacts of its actions as an integral part of its regulatory process. FDA regulations at 21 CFR part 25 specify that EAs must be submitted as part of certain NDAs, abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), biologic license applications (BLAs), supplements to such applications, and investigational new drug applications (INDs), as well as for various other actions, unless the action qualifies for a categorical exclusion. Failure to submit either an EA or a claim of categorical exclusion is sufficient grounds for FDA to refuse to file or approve an application (21 CFR 25.15(a), 314.101(d)(4), and 601.2(a) and (c)).

Categorical exclusions for actions related to human drugs and biologics are listed at 21 CFR 25.31. This guidance focuses on the categorical exclusion for actions on NDAs and NDA supplements that would increase the use of an active moiety, but the estimated concentration of the substance at the point of entry into the aquatic environment would be below 1 part per billion (1 ppb) (21 CFR 25.31(b)). Although an action that qualifies for this exclusion ordinarily does not require an EA, FDA will require ""at least an EA"" if ""extraordinary circumstances"" indicate that the specific proposed action (e.g., the approval of the NDA) may significantly affect the quality of the human environment (21 CFR 25.21).4 One example of extraordinary circumstances provided in FDA's regulations is an action for which available data establish that, at the expected level of exposure, there is the potential for serious harm to the environment (21 CFR 25.21(a)).

Consistent with these regulations, when the sponsor of an NDA or NDA supplement5 submits a claim of categorical exclusion under 21 CFR 25.31(b), FDA considers whether extraordinary circumstances exist under 21 CFR 25.21. If extraordinary circumstances exist, FDA will require the sponsor to submit an EA. If FDA needs more information to determine whether extraordinary circumstances exist, FDA may ask the sponsor to submit additional information concerning the potential environmental effects of approval of the sponsor's application or supplement. In light of research indicating that drugs with endocrine-related activity and, more specifically, drugs with E, A, or T activity, have the potential to cause developmental or reproductive effects in the aquatic environment at concentrations below 1 ppb,6 FDA has, on a case-by-case basis, requested additional information from sponsors to help it determine whether extraordinary circumstances exist. However, late cycle requests for additional environmental information have the potential to delay approval of applications. Accordingly, this guidance is intended to clarify that sponsors of drugs with potential E, A, or T activity should consult with the Agency early in product development concerning the information FDA may need to determine whether an EA will be required or whether a claim of categorical exclusion will be acceptable, and what information should be included in the EA or claim of categorical exclusion.","I'm sorry, but with the provided context, it's impossible to determine which document is the most relevant to your query.

   Categorical exclusions for actions related to human drugs and biologics are listed at 21 CFR 25.31. This guidance focuses on the categorical exclusion for actions on NDAs and NDA supplements that would increase the use of an active moiety, but the estimated concentration of the substance at the point of entry into the aquatic environment would be below 1 part per billion (1 ppb) (21 CFR 25.31(b)). Although an action that qualifies for this exclusion ordinarily does not require an EA, FDA will require ""at least an EA"" if ""extraordinary circumstances"" indicate that the specific proposed action (e.g., the approval of the NDA) may significantly affect the quality of the human environment (21 CFR 25.21).4 One example of extraordinary circumstances provided in FDA's regulations is an action for which available data establish that, at the expected level of exposure, there is the potential for serious harm to the environment (21 CFR 25.21(a)).

A pedigree would be required for prescription drug products that are sold, purchased, or traded by a non-ADR after December 1, 2006. In order to give wholesalers sufficient time to prepare and deplete stock that would require a pedigree after December 1, FDA provided 6 months' notice that the stay would expire on December 1, 2006. However, FDA recognizes that there may be some situations where a wholesaler has prescription drugs in stock that were purchased while the wholesaler considered itself an ADR, yet the wholesaler clearly will not be an ADR for those drugs under 21 C.F.R. SS 202.3(u) after December 1, 2006. FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion until April 1, 2007 regarding the pedigree requirement for such drugs, provided that the wholesaler can furnish documentation that the drugs were purchased prior to December 1, 2006, and that it had purchased the same type of drugs from the manufacturer on at least two prior occasions in the previous 24 months. Bills of sale or invoices could be used for this documentation. Wholesalers that cannot meet this criteria with respect to their inventories will be expected to provide a pedigree for those drugs. FDA believes that the combination of the six month notice that the stay would expire, along with additional four months of enforcement discretion, as described above,provides the wholesalers described above with sufficient time to deplete their pre-December 1, 2006 inventories.","Prescription Requirement Under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act Guidance for Industry ","Question: Is a pedigree required for products already in the supply chain as of December 1, 2006?

In order to give wholesalers sufficient time to prepare and deplete stock that would require a pedigree after December 1, FDA provided 6 months' notice that the stay would expire on December 1, 2006. However, FDA recognizes that there may be some situations where a wholesaler has prescription drugs in stock that were purchased while the wholesaler considered itself an ADR, yet the wholesaler clearly will not be an ADR for those drugs under 21 C.F.R. SS 202.3(u) after December 1, 2006. FDA intends to exercise its enforcement discretion until April 1, 2007 regarding the pedigree requirement for such drugs, provided that the wholesaler can furnish documentation that the drugs were purchased prior to December 1, 2006, and that it had purchased the same type of drugs from the manufacturer on at least two prior occasions in the previous 24 months. Bills of sale or invoices could be used for this documentation. Wholesalers that cannot meet this criteria with respect to their inventories will be expected to provide a pedigree for those drugs. FDA believes that the combination of the six month notice that the stay would expire, along with additional four months of enforcement discretion, as described above,provides the wholesalers described above with sufficient time to deplete their pre-December 1, 2006 inventories.

chapter-1-general.mmd,"After reviewing Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Appeals Processes Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, What is a ""Significant Decision""?","The documentation and review procedures required by section 517A of the FD&C Act apply only to ""significant decisions"" concerning submissions under sections 510(k) (Premarket Notification), 515 (Premarket Approval or ""PMA""/Humanitarian Device Exemption or ""HDE""), 515B (Breakthrough Devices), or 520(g) (Investigational Device Exemption or ""IDE"") of the FD&C Act. ""Significant decision"" is not explicitly defined in section 517A of the FD&C Act. For purposes of this guidance, we refer to ""significant decisions"" made by CDRH that are within the scope of section 517A as ""517A decisions."" Therefore, a request for supervisory review of a 517A decision must follow the procedures and timeframes set forth in section 517A(b) of the FD&C Act and its implementing regulations found in 21 CFR 800.75. As stated in 21 CFR 800.75, 517A decisions include the following types of decisions:

* 510(k) (Premarket Notification): Not Substantially Equivalent; Substantially Equivalent;
* PMA/HDE (Premarket Approval/Humanitarian Device Exemption): Not Approvable; Approvable; Approval; Denial;
* Breakthrough Device Designation Request4: Request for breakthrough designation for devices subject to 510(k), PMA, or De Novo classification. Grant; Denial of request for breakthrough designation; Footnote 4: Breakthrough Devices Program  Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff, available at: https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/breakthrough-devices-program.
* IDE (Investigational Device Exemption): Disapproval; Approval;
* Failure to Reach Agreement on a Protocol under Section 520(g)(7) of the FD&C Act; and
* ""Clinical Hold"" Determinations under Section 520(g)(8) of the FD&C Act.

Under 21 CFR 800.75, the timeframes and procedures specified in section 517A of the FD&C Act for 517A decisions regarding premarket submissions apply to sequential requests for supervisory review of such decisions within CDRH. For example, if a company that requests supervisory review of a 517A decision at the Office level further appeals the Office decision to the next higher level, FDA would apply the procedures and timeframes specified in section 517A of the FD&C Act to both of these appeals.

There are regulatory actions that do not constitute 517A decisions for purposes of 21 CFR_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_

800.75 and thus are not subject to 21 CFR 800.75(b)(1). These types of appeals are subject to 21 CFR 10.75 and 21 CFR 800.75(b)(2). CDRH refers to these decisions as ""non-517A decisions"". Examples of non-517A decisions include, but are not limited to, the following:

* 510(k) Requests for Additional Information;
* De Novo Requests for Additional Information and Final Decisions;
* PMA Major Deficiency Letters;
* 510(k), PMA and HDE Refuse to Accept/Refuse to File Letters;
* Postmarket Surveillance Orders under Section 522 of the FD&C Act;
* Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Waiver Decisions;
* Warning Letters; and
* Response Letter to a Request for Information under Section 513(g) of the FD&C Act.

These requests for supervisory review would not trigger the requirements under section 517A of the FD&C Act.

Note that the requirements for non-517A decisions within 21 CFR 10.75 and 21 CFR

800.75(b)(2) also apply to sequential requests for supervisory review of such decisions within CDRH. As such, a request for supervisory review within CDRH under 21 CFR 10.75 for a non-517A decision that is not received by CDRH within 60 days after the date of the decision involved will be denied as untimely, unless CDRH, for good cause related to circumstances

beyond the control of the submitter, such as snow emergency, Federal Government shutdown, or other unforeseen emergency event, permits the request to be filed after 60 days5.

Footnote 5: 21 CFR 800.75(b)(2)",Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) Appeals Processes Guidance for Industry and Food and Drug Administration Staff,"Question: What is a ""Significant Decision""?
  Answer: The documentation and review procedures required by section 517A of the FD&C Act apply only to ""significant decisions"" concerning submissions under sections 510(k) (Premarket Notification), 515 (Premarket Approval or ""PMA""/Humanitarian Device Exemption or ""HDE""), 515B (Breakthrough Devices), or 520(g) (Investigational Device Exemption or ""IDE"") of the FD&C Act.

(Potassium_Iodide)_KI_in_Radiation_Emergencies-Questions_and_Answers_DECEMBER_2002.mmd,"Based on the information from Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies , How critical to public health is adherence to FDA's recommendations with regard to projected thyroid radioactive exposure thresholds for intervention by risk category? Specifically, the existence of different thresholds for neonates, children through age 18, and pregnant or lactating women (\(\geq\) 5 cGy) versus adults aged 18 through 40 years (\(\geq\) 10 cGy) versus adults over age 40 (\(\geq\) 500 cGy) are confusing and logistically complex to follow in responding to a radiological emergency.","The FDA recommendations for KI intervention encompass different threshold thyroid radioactive exposures for different groups within the population. Several factors were involved in this approach:
* During the Chernobyl accident, younger people exposed to radioactive iodine (especially children 0 to 4 years old) were most sensitive to its carcinogenic effects.
In the years following the accident, most children who subsequently developed thyroid cancer apparently received internal thyroid radioactive exposures of less than 30 cGy, and the best dose-response information supports increased risk in children receiving 5 cGy or more.
* As age increases, the risk of thyroidal side effects following excess (i.e., nonradioactive) iodine ingestion increases. This is due to the increasing prevalence of underlying thyroidal illness with older age (e.g., Graves' disease, thyroid nodules, Hashimoto's thyroiditis).
* Thyroid irradiation in older adults (e.g., over 40 years of age) is associated with an extremely low incidence of cancer. Therefore, KI is only recommended if a very large internal radioactive dose to the thyroid is projected. In such a situation, KI would be ingested to prevent destruction of the thyroid gland, which, if it occurred, would lead to lifelong dependence on thyroid hormone replacement therapy.

In short, the recommended stepped intervention approach to KI use during radiation emergencies is based on differences in overall benefit versus risk in different population groups. Specifically, the benefits from thyroid blockade with KI predominate in the young in whom the risks of thyroid cancer from radioiodine are the greatest. The risks of KI take on more prominence in older adults in whom the risks of thyroid cancer are very small.

Notwithstanding the above, it is important to note that among 7 million adults who took stable iodine in Poland following Chernobyl, only two severe adverse reactions were reported, both in persons with known allergy to iodine. Based on these data, we have concluded that even if the risks associated with excess stable iodine are greater in adults than in children, the risk of serious adverse reactions overall is exceedingly small.

In summary, FDA understands that a KI administration program that sets different projected thyroid radioactive exposure thresholds for treatment of different population groups may be logistically impractical to implement during a radiological emergency. If emergency planners reach this conclusion, FDA recommends that KI be administered to both children and adults at the lowest intervention threshold (i.e., \(\geq 5\) cGy projected internal thyroid exposure in children).

As a rule, however, individuals with known allergy to KI or with pre-existing thyroid disease (e.g., Graves' disease, thyroid nodules, Hashimoto's thyroiditis) that might predispose them to adverse reactions should avoid KI. Most likely these will be adults, who have little or no risk of developing thyroid cancer from radioactive exposure to the thyroid and who may, in these cases, incur substantial risks from taking KI.",Potassium Iodide as a Thyroid Blocking Agent in Radiation Emergencies ,"Question: How critical to public health is adherence to FDA's recommendations with regard to projected thyroid radioactive exposure thresholds for intervention by risk category?

The applicant is required to pay an API-related fee for each API manufactured in its own facility or facilities for which it has not previously paid an API-related fee. As with a DMF fee, this fee is paid only once.

The amount of the API-related fee is a function of the number of APIs referenced in the application and the number of facilities in which those APIs are manufactured. If the ANDA references more than one facility as manufacturing each API, the applicant must pay the API-related fee for each such facility. See the examples that follow.

GDUFA specifies that the ANDA applicant must pay a fee for each API facility for which an API-related fee has not previously been paid that is described in the generic drug submission by means other than reference to a DMF.

The ANDA sponsor may remove sites that are no longer used, but in some cases may need to provide justification if the site being removed has not been replaced by another appropriate site to continue the approved function.

An ANDA sponsor can identify a facility that it does not own in its application only if the owner of that facility has provided the ANDA sponsor permission to refer to the facility.

_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_

If the owner of the facility withdraws that permission, FDA will consider that facility to no longer be identified in the application as of the date when FDA receives notice of that withdrawal. Please note that if the permission is withdrawn the facility will no longer be approved for manufacture of the FDF, or the API, covered by that application.

Since a facility continues to incur facility fees until FDA is notified of the facility's withdrawal of permission, the Agency encourages a person who wishes to withdraw permission for its facility to be identified in an ANDA to take the following steps prior to the FY fee due date:

1. Notify the ANDA sponsor and/or DMF holder in writing that it is withdrawing its permission to reference the facility in its ANDA and/or DMF.
2. Send a copy of this letter to the standard application submission methods for ANDAs and DMFs via FDA electronic gateway or by mail to the ANDA archival file at the following address: Office of Generic Drugs (HFD-600) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research Food and Drug Administration Document Control Room Metro Park North VII 7620 Standish Pl. Rockville, MD 20855
3. In addition, email the copy of the withdrawal letter to the Division of User Fee Management and Budget Formulation at CDERCollections@fda.hhs.gov.
4. If you are a DMF holder, be sure to also update your DMF with this change.
5. **Will a facility owner have to pay a GDUFA fee if the facility is manufacturing only non-generic APIs or FDFs, but is referenced in a generic drug submission?** Yes. An entity will incur facility fees if it manufactures any human drugs and is referenced in a generic drug submission on the facility fee due date.
6. **Will a facility owner have to pay a GDUFA fee if the facility is referenced in a generic drug submission, but is only manufacturing drugs for the non-US market?** Yes.
7. **Does a facility that is not currently manufacturing an API or FDF have to pay the applicable facility fees?** A facility listed in a generic drug submission - pending or approved - incurs annual facility fees as long as it is identified in a generic drug submission, even if the facility has not started commercial-scale production of the API or FDF covered by that submission, or if the facility has stopped, temporarily or permanently, the production of that API or FDF. See question 38 for a description of how a facility can ensure that it is no longer identified in an ANDA. The facility will cease to incur additional fees if it is no longer identified in any generic drug submission or has stopped manufacturing all APIs and FDFs (including both generic and non-generic APIs and FDFs) by the date that the fee is due. Any outstanding fee obligations will, however, remain due.
4. **If a facility manufactures both FDFs and APIs for generic drugs, does it incur more than one facility fee?** Yes. Under GDUFA, such a facility incurs annual FDF and API facility fees. Any such facility incurs both fees regardless of whether the API is offered for sale as an API or is offered for sale only after it is further processed so as to become an FDF within the meaning of the statute.
5. **Is a facility that manufactures an API excipient mixture or a mixture of two or more APIs used to produce FDFs required to pay an annual FDF facility fee?** Generally, manufacturers of API mixtures are required to pay the annual FDF facility fee. However, GDUFA provides one exception, for fee-paying purposes only, to the definition of in-process mixtures as FDF. GDUFA defines an API mixture as an API when it is produced because the API is unstable and cannot be transported on its own. Examples include: an API mixed with an antioxidant for chemical stability when the API is prone to oxidative degradation or an API excipient mixture for physical stability to maintain its amorphous form. Any facility producing an API and further processing it with an excipient or another API is also required to pay an annual API fee, regardless of whether the API is offered for sale as an API or is offered for sale only after it is further processed so as to become an FDF within the meaning of the statute.
6. **Who does FDA consider as a packager for purposes of GDUFA?** If you receive product prior to the point in the manufacturing process in which the drug is first packaged in a container/closure system specified in the ""How Supplied"" section of an approved ANDA and you package that product into such a container/closure system for the first time, you are a packager for purposes of GDUFA.

* Those responsible for payment of fees enter required information on FDA's website to generate a GDUFA user fee payment cover sheet.
* The cover sheet is designed to provide the minimum necessary information to determine if a person has satisfied all relevant user fee obligations.

_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_

* The cover sheet is submitted to FDA electronically generating a receipt with a user fee payment identification (ID) number to assist in tracking payment.
* Fee payers may pay online by credit card or Automated Clearing House (ACH) electronic check or send payment by check, bank draft, U.S. postal money order, or wire transfer. Cover sheets should be submitted with generic drug submissions and DMFs. The Generic Drug User Fee Cover Sheet and additional payment information is available on the GDUFA website (www.fda.gov/gdufa).
* **Is payment accepted in non-U.S. currency?** No. Payment must be made in U.S. currency drawn on a U.S. bank by electronic payments (such as by credit card or ACH electronic check), check, bank draft, U.S. postal money order, or wire transfer.
* **What happens if a person pays less than the full amount of required GDUFA fees?** FDA's expectation is for full and timely payment of all GDUFA fees. Penalties associated with non-payment, including refusal to receive a generic drug submission and failure of a DMF to be placed on a publicly available reference list, will apply until such obligations are satisfied in full.

On September 6, 2016, FDA published a final rule that finalizes the nonmonograph status of 19 active ingredients, including triclosan and triclocarban, which are intended for use in OTC consumer antiseptic wash products (81 FR 61106) (Consumer Antiseptic Wash Final Rule). Three active ingredients-- benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride, and chloroxylenol -- were deferred from the final rule to allow more time for sponsors who proposed to complete the studies necessary to fill the safety and effectiveness data gaps identified for these ingredients. These deferrals are for one year, subject to renewal if adequate progress is made in filling the data gaps.

The final rule applies to consumer antiseptic wash products that are intended for use with water and are rinsed off after use, including consumer hand washes and consumer body washes. No additional safety or effectiveness data were submitted to support monograph conditions for the 19 consumer antiseptic wash active ingredients. Therefore, with the exception of the three deferred active ingredients, this rule finalizes the nonmonograph status of the remaining 19 active ingredients which are found to be not GRASE for use in consumer antiseptic wash products. Consumer antiseptic wash drug products containing one or more of these non-GRASE active ingredients will be considered new drugs for which approved new drug applications (NDAs) are required for marketing (21 USC 355(a)).

chapter-1-general.mmd,This question is about Label Comprehension Studies for Nonprescription Drug Products  What information must be included on the label of an OTC drug marketed without an approved application for purposes of complying with section 502(x) of the Act?,"Section 2(d) of Public Law 109-462 adds section 502(x) to the Act to require the label of an OTC drug marketed in the United States without an approved application to include ""a domestic address or domestic phone number through which the responsible person [i.e., the manufacturer, packer, distributor, or retailer identified on the drug label]... may receive a report of a serious adverse event"" associated with the use of the drug product. If the label does not include the required domestic address or phone number, the drug is misbranded.

When the responsible person chooses to provide a domestic address (rather than a domestic phone number) for adverse event reporting, FDA concludes that the statute requires the product label to bear a full U.S. mailing address that includes the street address or P.O. Box, and the city, state, and zip code of the responsible person. FDA finds that Congress's use of the term _domestic address_ in section 502(x) of the Act is a clear and unambiguous directive that labels of OTC drug products marketed without an approved application include all information necessary to enable a serious adverse event report to reach the responsible person. This reading of section 502(x) of the Act is supported by dictionary definitions of _address_, which include ""the indication of destination, as on mail or parcels"" and ""the location at which a person or an organization may be reached.""4 Indeed, an address does not serve its intended purpose unless it includes all the information necessary to enable mail to reach its destination.

Footnote 4: _Webster_ II New Riverside University Dictionary_ (Houghton Mifflin 1984), p. 77.

Similarly, when the responsible person chooses to provide a domestic phone number for adverse event reporting, FDA concludes that the statute requires the phone number on the product label to include the area code (e.g., a toll-free area code such as 800 or a local area code such as 301).

For each of their products, manufacturers and repackagers are responsible for determining the smallest individual saleable unit that they intend for ultimate sale to a dispenser. Under the DSCSA, both a 2D data matrix barcode and the human-readable portion of the product identifier are required to be affixed or imprinted on each such individual saleable unit. While other levels of product packaging may exist that do not require a 2D data matrix barcode, as noted in Question and Answer #19, manufacturers and repackagers may voluntarily affix or imprint a 2D data matrix barcode if the product remains compliant with all other labeling requirements, including the linear barcode requirements under SS 201.25.

The following table provides examples of different units of a package or case and what barcode would be required under the DSCSA and under SS 201.25. It is not an exhaustive list because the information required will depend on the specific details of particular product packaging.

For mutagenic impurities, the 30 percent threshold of the ICH M7 acceptable limit serves to identify the level above which a mutagenic impurity is considered to have an impact on the impurity profile of the drug substance.

(5.8)","ICH Q11 recommends that ""manufacturing steps that impact the impurity profile of the drug substance should normally be included in the manufacturing process described in section 3.2.S.2.2 of the application."" However, as described in ICH Q11 Example 4, this principle does not necessarily apply when impurities originate early and ""persist"" across multiple steps to the drug substance. It is normally expected that the justification for an impurity that persists will be based on it being carried across one or more manufacturing steps upstream of the proposed starting material, when these steps do not otherwise impact the impurity profile of the drug substance (for ""impact,"" see Q&A 5.7).

In Example 4, an impurity in Compound B impacts the impurity profile of the drug substance. Steps 2 and 3 (from Compound B to Compound D) do not introduce other impurities that impact the drug substance impurity profile. If impurities generated in Steps 2 or 3 do impact the drug substance impurity profile, these steps should also be considered for inclusion in 3.2.S.2.2 of the application.

Impurities that persist may or may not react in subsequent steps, but are not removed to the extent that they would no longer be considered to impact the drug substance impurity profile. For example, an impurity that persists might have physico-chemical properties (e.g., solubility) similar to other intermediates or the drug substance, like the enantiomer in Example 4, which could make its removal intrinsically difficult.

ICH Q11 Example 4 illustrates that when the synthetic route contains an impurity that persists, it can be acceptable to control the impurity in the starting material specification even though it impacts the impurity profile of the drug substance. Therefore, it is not always necessary to include steps that form such an impurity in section 3.2.S.2.2, provided that the other ICH Q11 general principles are addressed (ICH Q11 section 5.1.1).

Next, the applicant should examine the steps immediately upstream of those steps that impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. These steps should normally also be included in section 3.2.S.2.2 if:

* They need to be carefully controlled (e.g., within narrow parameter ranges) to prevent generation of impurities that would otherwise impact the impurity profile of the drug substance.
* They include a unit operation that has been added to the manufacturing process to control specific impurities that would otherwise impact the impurity profile of the drug substance. While starting material manufacturing processes typically contain purification operations, addition of purification steps prior to a proposed starting material in order to avoid defining an earlier, upstream compound as the starting material would not be considered appropriate.

After these considerations, if the evaluation would result in only a small number of chemical transformation steps, then it is generally appropriate to include one or more additional chemical transformation steps in section 3.2.S.2.2. This is to ensure that enough steps are conducted under GMP to appropriately mitigate risks associated with contamination and future changes to the synthetic route or supplier of the starting material. The following paragraphs provide further clarification on this risk mitigation and should be considered together.

* Although ICH Q11 does not specify how many steps should be performed under GMP, ICH Q11 recommends the inclusion of ""multiple chemical transformation steps"" in section 3.2.S.2.2 in order to reduce the risk of contamination and support the effective implementation of the control strategy throughout the product lifecycle. When there would be a small number of steps, there is an increased risk of contamination that needs to be addressed by the applicant in their starting material justification, and will often be best mitigated by including one or more additional steps in section 3.2.S.2.
* Potential risks from future changes to the starting material synthesis should also be considered (see Q&A 5.16). There is an increased risk that impurities generated as a result of a change to the manufacturing process upstream of the starting material may not be detected or purged appropriately if the starting material is only a small number of steps from the drug substance. In order to determine how many additional steps to include, the applicant may also consider other approaches to risk mitigation; for example, inclusion of analytical methodologies in the specification of the proposed starting material that are designed to detect a wide range of possible impurities based on different physical and chemical separation and detection principles. Appropriate acceptance criteria for unspecified impurities should be included in the specification.

However, under limited circumstances, surgical removal and subsequent implantation of the autologous HCT/P may be considered same surgical procedure even though the removal and future implantation may be a number of days apart. During this time, the HCT/P may be rinsed or cleansed andtemporarily stored after being labeled, pending implantation, and this would still be considered the same surgical procedure, provided no other processing steps and no other manufacturing steps beyond labeling and storage are performed.7

Footnote 7: Temporary storage of a cranial bone flap or portion of parathyroid tissue may include steps to preserve those HCT/Ps in an appropriate condition for reimplantation, such as disinfecting or cryopreservation.

Establishments that perform the following procedures consisting of more than a single operation generally would qualify for the exception in 21 CFR 1271.15(b):

1. Cranitotomy or craniectomy with subsequent implantation of the bone flap to reverse the cranial defect.
2. Parathyroidectomy with subsequent implantation of a portion of the tissue to preserve parathyroid function.

The exception generally applies only to those establishments that both remove and implant the autologous HCT/P at the same establishment. An establishment that removes an HCT/P for implantation into the same individual, but intends the HCT/P to be implanted at a different establishment, would not qualify for the exception. Shipping the HCT/P to another establishment for implantation raises safety concerns, such as contamination and cross-contamination, beyond those typically associated with surgery. The establishment shipping the autologous HCT/P for use at another establishment is distributing the HCT/P8, which is a manufacturing9 step, and therefore the shipping establishment must register, submit an HCT/P list under Part 1271, Subpart B, and follow all other applicable regulations in Part 1271.10

Footnote 8: _istribution means any conveyance or shipment (including importation and exportation) of an HCT/P that has been determined to meet all release criteria, whether or not such conveyance or shipment is entirely intrastate (21 CFR 1271.3(bb)).

  Answer: Generally, as discussed in the answer to Q5, procedures consisting of more than a single operation are not considered the same surgical procedure.

However, under limited circumstances, surgical removal and subsequent implantation of the autologous HCT/P may be considered same surgical procedure even though the removal and future implantation may be a number of days apart. During this time, the HCT/P may be rinsed or cleansed andtemporarily stored after being labeled, pending implantation, and this would still be considered the same surgical procedure, provided no other processing steps and no other manufacturing steps beyond labeling and storage are performed.7

Footnote 7: Temporary storage of a cranial bone flap or portion of parathyroid tissue may include steps to preserve those HCT/Ps in an appropriate condition for reimplantation, such as disinfecting or cryopreservation.

Establishments that perform the following procedures consisting of more than a single operation generally would qualify for the exception in 21 CFR 1271.15(b):

1. Cranitotomy or craniectomy with subsequent implantation of the bone flap to reverse the cranial defect.
2. Parathyroidectomy with subsequent implantation of a portion of the tissue to preserve parathyroid function.

The exception generally applies only to those establishments that both remove and implant the autologous HCT/P at the same establishment. An establishment that removes an HCT/P for implantation into the same individual, but intends the HCT/P to be implanted at a different establishment, would not qualify for the exception. Shipping the HCT/P to another establishment for implantation raises safety concerns, such as contamination and cross-contamination, beyond those typically associated with surgery.

Please clarify how to assess the adequacy of the positive control in the thorough QT study.

There are two conditions required for ensuring such assay sensitivity:

1. The positive control should show a significant increase in QTc, i.e., the lower bound of the one-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) must be above 0 ms. This shows that the trial is capable of detecting an increase in QTc, a conclusion that is essential to concluding that a negative finding for the test drug is meaningful.
2. The study should be able to detect an effect of about 5 ms (the QTc threshold of regulatory concern) if it is present. Therefore, the size of the effect of the positive control is of particular relevance. With this aim, there are at least two approaches: 1. To use a positive control showing an effect of greater than 5 ms (i.e., lower bound of a one-sided 95% CI \(>\) 5 ms). This approach has proven to be useful in many regulatory cases. However, if the positive control has too large an effect, the study's ability to detect a 5 ms QTc prolongation might be questioned.

How can the MAH (a) avoid repeating data in sections 15 and 16 and (b) provide sufficient detail to substantiate conclusions?","(a) Points to Consider in Avoiding Repetition in the PBRER

Although repetition of information across different sections of the PBRER is not entirely avoidable and sometimes appropriate, the MAH can consider providing instructions to its staff in its internal templates/guidance documents to minimize such repetition. These instructions could recommend cross-referencing earlier sections of the PBRER in which the data were initially presented. However, the MAH should not overuse cross-referencing, because this could prevent a clear message from being conveyed to the reader.

Sections 6 through 14 of the PBRER are intended to present only the data or findings from the various sources covered by these sections. In contrast, sections 15 and 16 are intended to present the relevant interpretation and evaluation of the significant data and findings from sections 6 through 14.

_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_

For example, if the MAH identifies a new and ongoing signal based on a literature report published during the reporting interval, the MAH should summarize the literature report in section 11 (Literature) and the identified safety signal should be included in the summary tabulation in section 15 (Overview of Signals). If the MAH refutes an ongoing safety signal based on the results of a randomized clinical trial completed during the reporting interval, then the MAH should briefly summarize the relevant study findings in section 7.1 (Completed Clinical Trials). In addition, the MAH should update the status of the signal in the section 15 signal tabulation, as well as provide a critical analysis of new and cumulative data in section 16.2 (Signal Evaluation). This integrated analysis should include the MAH's rationale and conclusions for refuting the signal. The analysis of the refuted signal discussed in section 16.2 should not completely repeat the findings included in section 7.1 but should instead provide a high-level summary that focuses on the evaluation and interpretation of these findings. Similarly, the summary analyses included in sections 16.2 and 16.3 should not be repeated in section 16.4 (Characterization of Risks) of the PBRER.

Appendix C of the E2C(R2) guidance provides a format for signal tabulation, including two examples; Appendix F provides further guidance on mapping signals and risks to the appropriate PBRER sections.

**(b) Points to Consider in Providing Sufficient Detail in Sections 15 and 16 of the PBRER**

**General Considerations:**

As described in section II.E (2.5) of the guidance, the MAH should tailor the level of detail it provides for both the presentation of findings (sections 6 through 14) and evaluation sections (sections 15 and 16) based upon the clinical significance of the presented findings; this involves medical and scientific judgment. The level of detail should be sufficient to substantiate the MAH's conclusions and any actions taken or proposed. In these sections, the MAH should discuss in greater detail any findings that have a substantial medical impact or call for a more in-depth evaluation of causality.

**Considerations for Specific Sections:**

**Section 15: Overview of Signals**

The MAH should provide in a summary table an overview of signals ongoing and closed in the reporting interval. Appendix C of the guidance provides an example summary table that contains information at a high level, as opposed to detailed data. For signals closed during the reporting interval, the MAH should supplement the information appearing in the table with a summary evaluation of available data in section 16.2.

What constitutes new information is efficacy/effectiveness information that might alter the known benefit profile of the product in the approved indication. As such, the MAH should not include new efficacy/effectiveness information that only confirms what was already known for the product. The same principle applies to other sections of the PBRER in which the MAH provides summaries of new, clinically important efficacy/effectiveness information that became available during the interval covered by the PBRER.

1. If the acceptable DHQ documents are implemented without modifications and in their entirety, as a complete process for administering questions to blood donors, the change is considered to be minor. You must report the change to FDA in your annual report under 21 CFR 601.12(d), noting the date the process was implemented.
2. If the acceptable DHQ documents are implemented in their entirety, but modified by: (a) adding additional, more restrictive eligibility criteria that are specific to your establishment; or (b) omitting questions related to cancer; organ, tissue, or bone marrow transplant; or, bone or skin graft, which FDA has not required or recommended for determining donor eligibility, the changes are considered to be minor. You must report the change to FDA in your annual report under 21 CFR 601.12(d), noting the date the process was implemented and describing the additional criteria or questions that were omitted from your questionnaire.
3.

* Full-Length PPTA Donor History Questionnaire.
* includes glossary, flow charts and references; describes how questions can be administered; and contains follow-up questions to further evaluate a potential donor's response to capture questions.

  Answer: We, FDA, find the SPDHQ documents version 3.0 dated June 2023, acceptable for use in screening Source Plasma donors. These documents are consistent with FDA requirements and recommendations for donor eligibility.

**Contains Nonbinding Recommendations**

Note, the SPDHQ documents contain questions related to the following donor medical history factors for which we currently do not have requirements or recommendations, including: cancer; certain organ, tissue, or bone marrow transplant; bone or skin graft; nervous system disease; diabetes; history of fainting, seizures or convulsions; relapsing disease; surgery, diagnostic or dental procedures; or acupuncture. By recognizing the acceptable SPDHQ documents as one way to satisfy FDA's regulatory requirements, we are not requiring or recommending that donors be screened or deferred for these factors. If you choose to implement the acceptable SPDHQ documents and omit these questions, you would still be in compliance with FDA requirements.

In addition, the acceptable SPDHQ documents include a donor acknowledgement statement.

When either a contemporaneous or a retrospective pathology peer review is part of a GLP toxicology study, the activity should be included in the study protocol or protocol amendment. The process should be guided by written procedures to establish the extent of the review and ensure the integrity of the study. Because the study pathologist is responsible for the overall pathology data, the pathology report will reflect the study pathologist's best scientific opinion and judgment regarding the diagnoses and pathological interpretations.

Pathology peer review should be planned, conducted, documented, and reported in accordance with established written procedures. These written procedures should be available to the peer-review pathologist(s) prior to the initiation of peer review as SOPs, or in the study protocol or study-protocol amendment.

The peer-review pathologist(s) should generate a signed and dated peer-review statement (document, report, memorandum, or certificate) for inclusion in the final study report. All peer-review pathologists' signature blocks (identity and affiliation) should be included in the peer-review statement that is contained in the final study report.

The peer-review statement should be signed and dated by the peer-review pathologist(s) and include the following information:

* Who performed the peer-review and the date(s) it was performed
* Whether the peer-review was performed contemporaneously or retrospectively
* Whether the peer-review was conducted in compliance with GLP regulations
* What tissues were examined microscopically, corresponding animal identification number, dose/treatment group, and the basis for their selection
* What format (e.g., glass slides or whole slide images) was used_Contains Nonbinding Recommendations_

[Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]","A sponsor may use a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product in certain studies to support a demonstration that the proposed biological product is biosimilar to the U.S.-licensed reference product. However, as a scientific matter, analytical studies and at least one clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) study, which may include pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoint(s) intended to support a demonstration of biosimilarity, must include an adequate comparison of the proposed biosimilar product directly with the U.S.-licensed reference product unless it can be scientifically justified that such a study is not needed.

If a sponsor seeks to use data from an animal study6 or a clinical study comparing its proposed biosimilar product to a non-U.S.-licensed product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act, the sponsor should provide adequate data or information to scientifically justify the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity and establish an acceptable bridge to the U.S.-licensed reference product.

The sponsor should submit information supporting the proposed clinical investigation with the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product under the IND application. This scenario may occur, for example, if a sponsor seeks to use data from a clinical study comparingits proposed biosimilar product to a non-U.S.-licensed product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act, and proposes to conduct a clinical PK study, with PD data, as appropriate, in the United States with all three products (i.e., the proposed biosimilar product, the U.S.-licensed reference product, and the non-U.S.-licensed product) to support establishment of a bridge between all three products and scientific justification for the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity to the U.S.-licensed reference product.

A non-U.S.-licensed comparator product is considered an investigational new drug in the United States, and thus would require an IND application for importation and use in the United States (see 21 CFR 312.110(a)). If a sponsor intends to conduct a clinical investigation in the United States using a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product, the IND requirements in 21 CFR part 312 also would apply to this product (see, e.g., 21 CFR 312.2).

With respect to chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) information, a sponsor should submit to the IND application as much of the CMC information required by 21 CFR 312.23(a)(7) as is available. However, FDA recognizes that a sponsor may not be able to obtain all of the CMC information required by 21 CFR 312.23(a)(7) for a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product for which it is not the manufacturer. In these circumstances, the sponsor can request in an IND submission that FDA waive the regulatory requirements related to CMC information on the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product (21 CFR 312.10). The waiver request must include at least one of the following:

* An explanation why compliance with the requirements of 21 CFR 312.23(a)(7) is unnecessary or cannot be achieved
* Information that will satisfy the purpose of the requirement by helping to ensure that the investigational new drug will have the proper identity, strength, quality, and purity
* Other information justifying a waiver15 Footnote 15: See 21 CFR 312.10(a).

Information that is relevant to whether the investigational new drug will have the proper identity, strength, quality, and purity may include, for example, information indicating whether the investigational new drug has been licensed by a regulatory authority that has similar scientific and regulatory standards as FDA (e.g., ICH countries). This should include, to the greatest extent possible, summary approval information and current product labeling made public by the foreign regulatory authority. In addition, a sponsor should also provide information on the conditions and containers that will be used to transport the drug product to the U.S. clinical site(s) and information on the relabeling and repackaging operations that will be used to relabel the drug product vials for investigational use. This should include information on how exposure of the product to light and temperature conditions outside of the recommended storage conditions will be prevented. A risk assessment on the impact the relabeling operations may have on drug product stability should also be included.

The sponsor should consult with the appropriate FDA review division regarding the CMC information necessary to support the proposed clinical study.",Labeling for Biosimilar Products Guidance for Industry ,"Question: If a non-U.S.-licensed product is proposed for importation and use in the United States in a clinical investigation intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) (e.g., a bridging clinical PK and/or PD study), is a separate IND required for the non-U.S.-licensed product? [Updated/Retained in Final September 2021]
  Answer: A sponsor may submit a single IND application for a development program that is intended to support licensure of a proposed product under section 351(k) of the PHS Act and includes use of a non-U.S.-licensed product. The sponsor should submit information supporting the proposed clinical investigation with the non-U.S.-licensed comparator product under the IND application. This scenario may occur, for example, if a sponsor seeks to use data from a clinical study comparingits proposed biosimilar product to a non-U.S.-licensed product to address, in part, the requirements under section 351(k)(2)(A) of the PHS Act, and proposes to conduct a clinical PK study, with PD data, as appropriate, in the United States with all three products (i.e., the proposed biosimilar product, the U.S.-licensed reference product, and the non-U.S.-licensed product) to support establishment of a bridge between all three products and scientific justification for the relevance of these comparative data to an assessment of biosimilarity to the U.S.-licensed reference product.

A non-U.S.-licensed comparator product is considered an investigational new drug in the United States, and thus would require an IND application for importation and use in the United States (see 21 CFR 312.110(a)). If a sponsor intends to conduct a clinical investigation in the United States using a non-U.S.-licensed comparator product, the IND requirements in 21 CFR part 312 also would apply to this product (see, e.g., 21 CFR 312.2).
